You can't deny our economy is roaring: *fastest GDP growth in 13 years *1M more job openings than people looking for work *record low unemployment *7 straight months of 3%+ wage growth *12 deregulations for every new regulation Thank you @realDonaldTrump! 
Super excited today that @realdonaldTrump is signing an executive order today to protect free speech rights for ALL students! Great work by @TPUSA and @charliekirk11 who have been pushing this since the first time I met him years ago A big momentous day! #MAGA 
President @realDonaldTrump's historic investments in our defense industrial base keep two of his biggest promises to voters: to rebuild our military and to bring back American manufacturing. 
Today, there are plenty of reasons for that trust. Manufacturing jobs are roaring back. Blue-collar workers are set to make almost $2,500 more in annual wages. We're investing billions more in our military, and our service members are getting the best raise in nearly a decade. 
Today we celebrate the lives and achievements of Americans with Down Syndrome. @VP and I will always stand with these wonderful families, and together we will always stand for LIFE! #WorldDownSyndromeDay

Not a good situation! 
....just the large States - the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States the entire Midwest would end up losing all power - we can‚Äôt let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote, but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A. 
Campaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier different than campaigning for the Electoral College. It‚Äôs like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to....

What the Democrats have done in trying to steal a Presidential Election, first at the ‚Äúballot box‚Äù and then, after that failed, with the ‚ÄúInsurance Policy,‚Äù is the biggest Scandal in the history of our Country!

So it was indeed (just proven in court papers) ‚Äúlast in his class‚Äù (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election. He the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!

It‚Äôs truly incredible that shows like Saturday Night Live, not funny/no talent, can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me), over over, without so much of a mention of ‚Äúthe other side.‚Äù Like an advertisement without consequences. Same with Late Night Shows...... 
I‚Äôd like to thank all of the Great Republican Senators who bravely voted for Strong Border Security and the WALL. This will help stop Crime, Human Trafficking, and Drugs entering our Country. Watch, when you get back to your State, they will LOVE you more than ever before! 
.....THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN! 
....should never have been appointed and there should be no Mueller Report. This was an illegal conflicted investigation in search of a crime. Russian Collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the Democrats for losing an Election that they thought they were going to win..... 
So, if there was knowingly acknowledged to be ‚Äúzero‚Äù crime when the Special Counsel was appointed, and if the appointment was made based on the Fake Dossier (paid for by Crooked Hillary) and now disgraced Andrew McCabe (he all stated no crime), then the Special Counsel.......

Economic security is national security. That's the principle at work as President @realDonaldTrump helps our veterans transition into great jobs at great wages in our Merchant Marine. More from Peter Navarro: 
Since the mainstream media doesn‚Äôt cover the booming @realDonaldTrump economy enough: -Wage growth just hit 3.4% ‚Äì the best in 10 years -Hispanic unemployment just hit a new record low -Unemployment has been 4% or lower for a full year ‚Äì the longest streak in 50 years! 
Will soon be 145 Judges! 
This is just the beginning! 
Democrats so far in 2019: ‚úÖWon't condemn anti-semitism in the House of Reps. ‚úÖDo nothing against a racist Governor who wore black face/klan robe. ‚úÖDo nothing against a Lt. Gov accused of sexual assault. ‚úÖInvestigate political opponents with no evidence. ‚úÖPro-Infanticide 
The Witch Hunt continues! 
....and renovated, with MUCH MORE to follow shortly. Tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended (captured) at the Border and NOT allowed into our Country. With another President, millions would be pouring in. I am stopping an invasion as the Wall gets built. #MAGA 
Wacky Nut Job @AnnCoulter, who still hasn‚Äôt figured out that, despite all odds and an entire Democrat Party of Far Left Radicals against me (not to mention certain Republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight), I am winning on the Border. Major sections of Wall are being built... 
I hope the grandstanding Governor of California is able to spend his very highly taxed citizens money on asylum holds more efficiently than money has been spent on the so-called Fast Train, which is $Billions over budget in total disarray. Time to reduce taxes in California! 
Is there anything that the Democrats stand for that aligns with American values anymore? Now that they‚Äôve gone all-in on anti-Semitism, infanticide, socialism, open borders, police-state spying, what‚Äôs left of this shell of a party? 
Before Michael Cohen's testimony last week, he and Adam Schiff met for TEN hours. But last Sunday, Schiff told CBS his only contact with Cohen was to "invite him to testify" and "allay concerns." Really? That took 10 hours? We need answers. Did Democrats lead the witness? 
Today I offered a motion to recommit #HR1 reaffirming that only US citizens should have the right to vote. Dems rejected it. Next time you go to the ballot box, keep that in mind. The future of their party is in cities like San Fran, where illegals can vote. Let that sink in. 
Border Patrol and Law Enforcement has apprehended (captured) large numbers of illegal immigrants at the Border. They won‚Äôt be coming into the U.S. The Wall is being built and will greatly help us in the future, and now! 
.@RepMikeTurner ‚ÄúThe only time that Michael Cohen told the truth is when he pled that he is guilty.‚Äù Also when he said no collusion and I did not tell him to lie!‚Äù

Cohen claimed his shady father-in-law's "in the clothing business" when in fact he's loan shark in same taxicab medallion biz as Cohen. More, his father-in-law's a convicted fraudster who was named, along with Cohen's wife, in investigation. Cohen chose to sing on Trump instead 
BREAKING: Democratic Rep. Jerry "Joe McCarthy" Nadler, who just yesterday declared that Trump obstructed justice, just now on CNN admitted he doesn't have the facts to prove obstruction of justice but just personally knows it to be true and will investigate. #DemFishingExpedition 
Despite running informants/stings on Trump camp, electronically spying for yr,unmasking NSA intercepts, rummaging thru Trump fixer's files, recordings, garbage, exploiting British intel probing by CIA, FBI/DOJ, DOS, SSCI/HPSCI, MSM SCO, Deep State still cannot prove collusion 
Glenn Simpson Christopher Steele r 2 of biggest villains in Russia collusion hoax, yet neither has faced serious scrutiny. They manufactured seeded the dossier lies disinformation. Yet Simpson still hasnt been subpoenaed to testify publicly before Senate. Ur move Sen Graham 
Now that even some MSM acknowledging there never was a "collusion" scandal, when will MSM start investigating the real scandal of Obama DOJ/FBI Clinton campaign making it look like there was? Oh that's right, the MSM were accomplices in that scandal. Never mind. #MediaCollusion

Congratulations to Heather Wilson, who is the sole finalist to become the next President of University of Texas at El Paso effective September 1, 2019. Heather has done an absolutely fantastic job... 
Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied! 
Heading now to the Great State of Alabama!

‚ÄúThis is as good a time as I can remember to be an American Worker. We have the strongest economy in the world.‚Äù Stuart Varney @foxandfriends So true! 
Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House Senate Intelligence Senator Burr. So bad for our Country! 
I cannot believe the level of dishonesty in the media. It is totally out of control, but we are winning! 
Thank you @foxandfriends. Great show! 
The Wall is being built and is well under construction. Big impact will be made. Many additional contracts are close to being signed. Far ahead of schedule despite all of the Democrat Obstruction and Fake News! 
Breaking News @MSNBC: ‚ÄúCohen‚Äôs lawyer contradicts Cohen‚Äôs testimony about never seeking a Presidential Pardon.‚Äù 
We are on track to APPREHEND more than one million people coming across the Southern Border this year. Great job by Border Patrol (and others) who are working in a Broken System. Can be fixed by Congress so easily and quickly if only the Democrats would get on board! 
It was not a campaign contribution, and there were no violations of the campaign finance laws by me. Fake News! 
Democrats just blocked @FoxNews from holding a debate. Good, then I think I‚Äôll do the same thing with the Fake News Networks and the Radical Left Democrats in the General Election debates! 
Wall Street Journal: ‚ÄúMore migrant families crossing into the U.S. illegally have been arrested in the first five months of the federal fiscal year than in any prior full year.‚Äù We are doing a great job at the border, but this is a National Emergency! 
Congressman Chris Stewart: ‚ÄúNo one is accusing the President of a crime and yet they (the Democrats) are issuing hundreds of subpoenas. This is unprecedented.‚Äù They are desperately trying to find anything they can, even a punctuation mistake in a document! 
American Workforce Policy Advisory Board Meeting at the @WhiteHouse! 
It is shameful that House Democrats won‚Äôt take a stronger stand against Anti-Semitism in their conference. Anti-Semitism has fueled atrocities throughout history and it‚Äôs inconceivable they will not act to condemn it! 
Senate Republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent, they are voting on desperately needed Border Security the Wall. Our Country is being invaded with Drugs, Human Traffickers, Criminals of all shapes and sizes. That‚Äôs what this vote is all about. STAY UNITED!

Hans Von Spakovsky, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen any evidence of actual violations of the law, which is usually a basis before you start an investigation. Adam Schiff seems to be copying Joseph McCarthy in wanting to open up investigations when they don‚Äôt have any evidence of wrongdoing.‚Äù 
.@JerryNadler admits on #CNN they have no proof of Obstruction by @realDonaldTrump it's just his "personal opinion" Meet the new #WitchHunt Same as the old #WitchHunt cc @DonaldJTrumpJr 
While @realDonaldTrump was successful in the private sector, career politicians enrich themselves by spending decades in DC. Now they're attacking his success through a fishing expedition. They know there was no Russia collusion. These are investigations in search of a crime. 
Statement on Chairman Nadler‚Äôs fishing expedition. 
‚Äú(Crooked) Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020, rules out a third bid for White House.‚Äù Aw-shucks, does that mean I won‚Äôt get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed!

‚ÄúThe American Media has changed forever. News organizations that seemed like a big deal are now extinct. Those that remain have now degraded themselves beyond recognition, like the New Yorker - or they‚Äôve been purchased by Jeff Bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for......... 
President Trump's message to those affected by the tornadoes in the Gulf states: "We grieve by your side and we pledge our unwavering support to help you rebuild from the very depths of this horrible tragedy." 
‚ÄúThere is no Collusion. All of these investigations are in search of a crime. Democrats have no evidence to impeach President Trump. Ridiculous!‚Äù @DevinNunes @FoxNews 
‚ÄúNow that the Dems are going to try switch from Collusion to some other reason, it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didn‚Äôt accept the WILL OF THE PEOPLE in the last election - they will do anything to get rid of the President.‚Äù @AriFleischer It will never work! 
The military drills, or war games as I call them, were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NK‚ÄîFAKE NEWS! I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those ‚Äúgames‚Äù, especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost! 
FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovernorKayIvey, one of the best in our Country, has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!). 
I completely agree with Kevin McCarthy. While @realDonaldTrump was in Vietnam, Democrats were making bogus attacks back in DC. 
To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas: Please be careful and safe. Tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. To the families and friends of the victims, and to the injured, God bless you all!

For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the ‚Äúwalk.‚Äù Never done when a president is overseas. Shame! 
....President. We are WINNING big, the envy of the WORLD, but just think what it could be? 
Presidential Harassment by ‚Äúcrazed‚Äù Democrats at the highest level in the history of our Country. Likewise, the most vicious and corrupt Mainstream Media that any president has ever had to endure - Yet the most successful first two years for any 
The reason I do not want military drills with South Korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed. That was my position long before I became President. Also, reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing! 
My wonderful daughter, Ivanka, will be interviewed tonight by Steve Hilton on ‚ÄúThe Next Revolution.‚Äù @FoxNews 9:00 P.M. She works so hard and has achieved so much for the U.S.A.(and gets so little credit!). Then watch Mark Levin at 10:00 P.M., a great show! 
‚ÄúLook how they‚Äôre acting now and how we act when we‚Äôre in the majority. What the Democrats are doing is an abuse of power. They couldn‚Äôt find anything...they took a Fake Dossier couldn‚Äôt find any Collusion. Now they have a fake witness in Cohen.‚Äù Congressman Mark Green, (R-TN). 
After more than two years of Presidential Harassment, the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and other broke the law. The hostile Cohen testimony, given by a liar to reduce his prison time, proved no Collusion! His just written book manuscript showed what he..... 
...said was a total lie, but Fake Media won‚Äôt show it. I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election! Despite this, great success! 
We‚Äôve got NASA ‚Äúrocking‚Äù again. Great activity and success. Congrats to SPACEX and all! 
The brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer Michael Cohen shows his testimony was a total lie! Pundits should only use it. 
Virtually everything failed lawyer Michael Cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me. It‚Äôs a total new love letter to ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction! 
Thank you @marklevinshow!

I hope our great Republican Senators don‚Äôt get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders, we don‚Äôt have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don‚Äôt fall into the Democrats ‚Äútrap‚Äù of Open Borders and Crime!

I have asked China to immediately remove all Tariffs on our agricultural products (including beef, pork, etc.) based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with Trade discussions.... 
....for Otto‚Äôs mistreatment and death. Most important, Otto Warmbier will not have died in vain. Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future. I love Otto and think of him often! 
I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family. Remember, I got Otto out along with three others. The previous Administration did nothing, and he was taken on their watch. Of course I hold North Korea responsible.... 
Michael Cohen‚Äôs book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer? 
...and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday. No way, it‚Äôs time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt. Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now! 
Oh‚Äô I see! Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart, there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, they say, ‚Äúgee, I have an idea, let‚Äôs look at Trump‚Äôs finances and every deal he has ever done. Let‚Äôs follow discredited Michael Cohen..... 
Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen‚Äôs new book, given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited! 
Wow, just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a ‚Äúlove letter to Trump‚Äù manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki, his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie! 
Great to be back from Vietnam, an amazing place. We had very substantive negotiations with Kim Jong Un - we know what they want and they know what we must have. Relationship very good, let‚Äôs see what happens! 
Today in Alaska, it was my great honor to visit with our brave men and women of the United States Military at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. We are forever grateful for their service and sacrifice. THANK YOU!

Great meetings and dinner tonight in Vietnam with Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Very good dialogue. Resuming tomorrow!

Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don‚Äôt mind executing babies AFTER birth.... 
....This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, it‚Äôs protecting the lives of innocent babies. 
The Democrats should stop talking about what I should do with North Korea and ask themselves instead why they didn‚Äôt do ‚Äúit‚Äù during eight years of the Obama Administration? 
Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history, for my friend Kim Jong Un. We will know fairly soon - Very Interesting!

President Xi of China has been very helpful in his support of my meeting with Kim Jong Un. The last thing China wants are large scale nuclear weapons right next door. Sanctions placed on the border by China and Russia have been very helpful. Great relationship with Chairman Kim!

Thank you @RonaldWeiser for serving the @MIGOP well and congratulations to my friend and new @MIGOPChair Laura Cox! I look forward to continue working with you to engage Michigan voters, grow our party, and re-elect @realDonaldTrump in 2020! 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not one shred of evidence that this president‚Äôs done anything Constitutionally (or anything else) wrong.‚Äù Graham Ledger. Thank you Graham, so true! 
The people of Venezuela stand at the threshold of history, ready to reclaim their country ‚Äì and their future.... 
74 years ago today, Marines on Iwo Jima raised the flag atop Mount Suribachi. Semper Fidelis. 
There is far more ENERGY on the Right than there is on the Left. That‚Äôs why we just won the Senate and why we will win big in 2020. The Fake News just doesn‚Äôt want to report the facts. Border Security is a big factor. The under construction Wall will stop Gangs, Drugs and Crime! 
God Bless the people of Venezuela!

I am pleased to announce that Kelly Knight Craft, our current Ambassador to Canada, is being nominated to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations.... 
BREAKING: In Oval Office meeting today, the Chinese committed to buy an additional 10 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans. Hats off to @POTUS for bringing China to the table. Strategy is working. Show of good faith by the Chinese. Also indications of more good news to come. 
A must read by @KimStrassel! 
Fake News is so bad for our Country! 
Highly respected Senator Richard Burr, head of Senate Intelligence, said, after interviewing over 200 witnesses and studying over 2 million pages of documents, ‚ÄúWE HAVE FOUND NO COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.‚Äù The Witch Hunt, so bad for our Country, must end! 
Wonderful evening at @WhiteHouse celebrating #AfricanAmericanHistoryMonth! 
We are here to honor the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to every aspect of American Life, History and Culture. From the earliest days of this Nation, African-American Leaders, Pioneers, Visionaries have uplifted inspired our Country...https://t.co/VuFLkfd12j 
Senator John Cornyn has done an outstanding job for the people of Texas. He is strong on Crime, the Border, the Second Amendment and loves our Military and Vets. John has my complete and total endorsement. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
.@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA 
THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW! 
....something that is so obviously the future. I want the United States to win through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies. We must always be the leader in everything we do, especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology! 
I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard. American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind. There is no reason that we should be lagging behind on......... 
I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country! 
We have just built this powerful Wall in New Mexico. Completed on January 30, 2019 ‚Äì 47 days ahead of schedule! Many miles more now under construction! #FinishTheWall 
California now wants to scale back their already failed ‚Äúfast train‚Äù project by substantially shortening the distance so that it no longer goes from L.A. to San Francisco. A different deal and record cost overruns. Send the Federal Government back the Billions of Dollars WASTED! 
The New York Times reporting is false. They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! 
‚ÄúIf thinking that James Comey is not a good FBI Director is tantamount to being an agent of Russia, than just list all the people that are agents of Russia - Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Rod Rosenstein who wrote the memo to get rid of Comey, the Inspector General....‚Äù Trey Gowdy 
‚ÄúThe Washington Post ignored basic journalistic standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump.‚Äù Covington student suing WAPO. Go get them Nick. Fake News! 
The Press has never been more dishonest than it is today. Stories are written that have absolutely no basis in fact. The writers don‚Äôt even call asking for verification. They are totally out of control. Sadly, I kept many of them in business. In six years, they all go BUST! 
Crazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well! 
‚ÄúAndrew McCabe gave absolutely no evidence of any threat to substantiate his ABSURD claim.‚Äù @LouDobbs 
This is crazy scary. A cabal of unelected bureaucrats-angered upset that @realDonaldTrump fired their boss-whispered about overthrowing him. Has this ever happened? Why isn‚Äôt the mainstream seeing this for what it is. This is malignant arrogance from a man fired for lying. 
I never said anything bad about Andrew McCabe‚Äôs wife other than she (they) should not have taken large amounts of campaign money from a Crooked Hillary source when Clinton was under investigation by the FBI. I never called his wife a loser to him (another McCabe made up lie)! 
The Washington Post is a Fact Checker only for the Democrats. For the Republicans, and for your all time favorite President, it is a Fake Fact Checker! 
The Washington Post is a Fact Checker only for the Democrats. For the Republicans, and for your all time favorite President, it is a Fake Fact Checker! 
The failed Fast Train project in California, where the cost overruns are becoming world record setting, is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed Wall! 
As I predicted, 16 states, led mostly by Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left, have filed a lawsuit in, of course, the 9th Circuit! California, the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train, with no hope of completion, seems in charge! 
Had the opposition party (no, not the Media) won the election, the Stock Market would be down at least 10,000 points by now. We are heading up, up, up! 
‚Äú....(The Witch Hunt) in time likely will become recognized as the greatest scandal in American political history, marking the first occasion in which the U.S. government bureaucrats sought to overturn an election (presidential)!‚Äù Victor Davis Hanson And got caught! @FoxNews 
Remember this, Andrew McCabe didn‚Äôt go to the bathroom without the approval of Leakin‚Äô James Comey! 
@realDonaldTrump Our country is making unprecedented progress thanks to the fact that we finally have a president who is keeping his promises and putting America first. 
Thank you Andrew - We all miss beautiful Meadow! 
Thank you JT! 
Amazing! 
‚ÄúThe biggest abuse of power and corruption scandal in our history, and it‚Äôs much worse than we thought. Andrew McCabe (FBI) admitted to plotting a coup (government overthrow) when he was serving in the FBI, before he was fired for lying leaking.‚Äù @seanhannity @FoxNews Treason! 
Today more than 50 countries around the world now recognize the rightful government of Venezuela. The Venezuelan people have spoken and the world has heard their voice. They are turning the page on Socialism and Dictatorship; and there will be NO GOING BACK! 
I ask every member of the Maduro regime: End this nightmare of poverty, hunger and death. LET YOUR PEOPLE GO. Set your country free! Now is the time for all Venezuelan Patriots to act together, as one united people. Nothing could be better for the future of Venezuela! 
The people of Venezuela are standing for FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY ‚Äì and the United States of America is standing right by their side! 
We are here to proclaim that a new day is coming in Latin America. In Venezuela and across the Western Hemisphere, Socialism is DYING - and liberty, prosperity, and democracy are being REBORN...https://t.co/hPL5W48Pmg 
A beautiful ceremony at @Nicklaus4kids hospital today to celebrate their new changes! I hope the garden nurtures heals all the young patients who visit. Thank you to the generous donors to @Nicklaus4kids for all the important work you are doing. #BeBest 
Hope you are enjoying your President‚Äôs Day, our Country is making unprecedented progress! 
‚ÄúThis was an illegal coup attempt on the President of the United States.‚Äù Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends True! 
Great analysis by @foxandfriends! 
....There is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the Military, Vets, Economy and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous ‚Äúinsurance policy‚Äù in full action! 
Wow, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying, and now his story gets even more deranged. He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by Jeff Sessions (another beauty), look like they were planning a very illegal act, and got caught.....

Disgraced FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe pretends to be a ‚Äúpoor little Angel‚Äù when in fact he was a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal the Russia Hoax - a puppet for Leakin‚Äô James Comey. I.G. report on McCabe was devastating. Part of ‚Äúinsurance policy‚Äù in case I won.... 
The Mueller investigation is totally conflicted, illegal and rigged! Should never have been allowed to begin, except for the Collusion and many crimes committed by the Democrats. Witch Hunt! 
‚ÄúThese guys, the investigators, ought to be in jail. What they have done, working with the Obama intelligence agencies, is simply unprecedented. This is one of the greatest political hoaxes ever perpetrated on the people of this Country, and Mueller is a coverup.‚Äù Rush Limbaugh 
THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! 
Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion! 
52% Approval Rating, 93% in Republican Party ( a record )! Pretty amazing considering that 93% (also) of my press is REALLY BAD. The ‚Äúpeople‚Äù are SMART! 
Democrats in the Senate are still slow walking hundreds of highly qualified people wanting to come into government. Never been such an abuse in our country‚Äôs history. Mitch should not let Senate go home until all are approved. We need our Ambassadors and all others NOW! 
Important meetings and calls on China Trade Deal, and more, today with my staff. Big progress being made on soooo many different fronts! Our Country has such fantastic potential for future growth and greatness on an even higher level!

....The U.S. does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go. We do so much, and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory! 
The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial. The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them........ 
Trade negotiators have just returned from China where the meetings on Trade were very productive. Now at meetings with me at Mar-a-Lago giving the details. In the meantime, Billions of Dollars are being paid to the United States by China in the form of Trade Tariffs!

President Trump Speaks on the National Security Humanitarian Crisis on Our Southern Border 
‚ÄúTrying to use the 25th Amendment to try and circumvent the Election is a despicable act of unconstitutional power grabbing...which happens in third world countries. You have to obey the law. This is an attack on our system Constitution.‚Äù Alan Dershowitz. @TuckerCarlson 
.@PressSec: President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action‚Äîincluding a national emergency‚Äîto ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border. 
‚ÄúAfter The Flight 93 Election, The Vote That Saved America - And What We Still Have To Lose,‚Äù by very talented Michael Anton, is a terrific read. Check it out! 
One year ago today, a horrific act of violence took the lives of 14 students and 3 educators in Parkland, Florida. On this somber anniversary, we honor their memory and recommit to ensuring the safety of all Americans, especially our Nation‚Äôs children...

The Gallup Poll just announced that 69% of our great citizens expect their finances to improve next year, a 16 year high. Nice! 
The Senate Intelligence Committee: THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA! 
I don‚Äôt feel an ounce of empathy for all of the imbeciles who bought into the Russian collusion hoax now that it‚Äôs been entirely debunked. You were warned for over a year about this scam you fell for it anyway. You did this to yourself. 
I want to thank all Republicans for the work you have done in dealing with the Radical Left on Border Security. Not an easy task, but the Wall is being built and will be a great achievement and contributor toward life and safety within our Country! 
President Trump's commitment to improving the quality of life for all Americans has led to the largest single decline in drug prices in 46 YEARS. 
Americans pay 180 percent of what Europeans, Canadians, and Japanese pay for the exact same drugs! Our seniors aren't going to foot the bill for free-riders abroad any longer, HHS Secretary Alex Azar says. 
They are soooo beautiful and magnificent! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Beautiful evening in El Paso, Texas last night. God Bless the USA! 
It was 45 degrees outside and this was the overflow crowd. #ElPaso @realDonaldTrump 
Happening Now: @realDonaldTrump overflow crowd in El Paso, Texas.... 
We are fighting for all Americans, from all backgrounds, of every age, race, religion, birthplace, color creed. Our agenda is NOT a partisan agenda ‚Äì it is the mainstream, common sense agenda of the American People. Thank you El Paso, Texas - I love you! 
Beto trying to counter-program @realdonaldtrump in his hometown and only drawing a few hundred people to Trump‚Äôs 35,000 is a really bad look. Partial pic of the Trump overflow crowd below! #AnyQuestions 
Coal is an important part of our electricity generation mix and @TVAnews should give serious consideration to all factors before voting to close viable power plants, like Paradise #3 in Kentucky! 
40 years of corruption. 40 years of repression. 40 years of terror. The regime in Iran has produced only #40YearsofFailure. The long-suffering Iranian people deserve a much brighter future. 
Will be heading to El Paso very soon. Big speech on Border Security and much else tonight. Tremendous crowd! See you later! 
The Democrats are so self righteous and ANGRY! Loosen up and have some fun. The Country is doing well! 
The Democrats do not want us to detain, or send back, criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy! 
No president ever worked harder than me (cleaning up the mess I inherited)! 
‚ÄúFact checkers have become Fake News.‚Äù @JesseBWatters So True! 
Working hard, thank you! 
The U.S. will soon control 100% of ISIS territory in Syria. @CNN (do you believe this?). 
WE AGREE! The time is now! "The time has come to pass school choice for America's children." - @realDonaldTrump #SOTU 
Agreed! Senate needs to confirm @realDonaldTrump Admin appointees. #SOTU 
Well, it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! 
The Border Committee Democrats are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally. Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts), but they don‚Äôt even want to take muderers into custody! What‚Äôs going on? 
‚ÄúPresident is on sound legal ground to declare a National Emergency. There have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.‚Äù Congressman @tommcclintock 
....The fact is, when I took over as President, our Country was a mess. Depleted Military, Endless Wars, a potential War with North Korea, V.A., High Taxes too many Regulations, Border, Immigration HealthCare problems, much more. I had no choice but to work very long hours! 
The media was able to get my work schedule, something very easy to do, but it should have been reported as a positive, not negative. When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President..... 
It was a very bad week for the Democrats, with the GREAT economic numbers, The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address. Now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee, I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject! 
I don‚Äôt think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention! 
Gallup Poll: ‚ÄúOpen Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans.‚Äù This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now! 
African Americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in Virginia! 
Senator Richard Burr, The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, just announced that after almost two years, more than two hundred interviews, and thousands of documents, they have found NO COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA! Is anybody really surprised by this? 
I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called ‚ÄúCarbon Footprint‚Äù to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant! 
Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz! 
The Democrats just don‚Äôt seem to want Border Security. They are fighting Border Agents recommendations. If you believe news reports, they are not offering much for the Wall. They look to be making this a campaign issue. The Wall will get built one way or the other! 
The #IngrahamAngle goes to El Paso Monday, where I‚Äôll be interviewing @realDonaldTrump. Tune in! 10p ET @FoxNews 
The corrupt spying operation against Donald Trump‚Äôs team is the biggest scandal in political history. Read my new book for the shocking details about the scheme to take down Trump. Pick up your copy here

Inside @JudicialWatch: @RealDonaldTrump is first president in a generation to talk honestly about the border crisis. 
.@AdamSchiff: -Meets with Glenn Simpson, who hired Nellie Ohr and Chris Steele and paid for the Dossier -Doesn‚Äôt disclose the meeting -Says there‚Äôs nothing wrong REMEMBER: Schiff demanded that Nunes be investigated for meeting with administration officials. Double standard? 
We have a great economy DESPITE the Obama Administration and all of its job killing Regulations and Roadblocks. If that thinking prevailed in the 2016 Election, the U.S. would be in a Depression right now! We were heading down, and don‚Äôt let the Democrats sound bites fool you! 
The Democrats in Congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see. When the Republicans had the Majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! The Dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win! 
It was great meeting some of our outstanding young military personnel who were wounded in both Syria and Afghanistan. Their wounds are deep but their spirit is sooo high. They will recoverer be back very soon. America loves them. Walter Reed Hospital is AMAZING - Thank you all! 
North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse. He may surprise some but he won‚Äôt surprise me, because I have gotten to know him fully understand how capable he is. North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket - an Economic one! 
My representatives have just left North Korea after a very productive meeting and an agreed upon time and date for the second Summit with Kim Jong Un. It will take place in Hanoi, Vietnam, on February 27 28. I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim advancing the cause of peace! 
I was a big fan of Frank Robinson, both as a great player and man. He was the first African American manager in baseball and was highly respected at everything he did. He will he missed! 
Deepest sympathies to Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and the entire family of John Dingell. Longest serving Congressman in Country‚Äôs history which, if people understand politics, means he was very smart. A great reputation and highly respected man. 
Working hard, thank you! 
...It is all a GIANT AND ILLEGAL HOAX, developed long before the election itself, but used as an excuse by the Democrats as to why Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the Election! Someday the Fake News Media will turn honest report that Donald J. Trump was actually a GREAT Candidate! 
The mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the VERY important Senate Intelligence Committee, after two years of intensive study and access to Intelligence that only they could get, just stated that they have found NO COLLUSION between ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù Russia.... 
Now we find out that Adam Schiff was spending time together in Aspen with Glenn Simpson of GPS Fusion, who wrote the fake and discredited Dossier, even though Simpson was testifying before Schiff. John Solomon of @thehill 
Not only did Senator Burr‚Äôs Committee find No Collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia, it‚Äôs important because they interviewed 200 witnesses and 300,000 pages of documents, the Committee has direct access to intelligence information that‚Äôs Classified. @GreggJarrett 
Highly respected Senator Richard Burr, Chairman of Senate Intelligence, said today that, after an almost two year investigation, he saw no evidence of Russia collusion. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.‚Äù Thank you! 
So nice how well my State of the Union speech was received. Thank you to all! 
Each year, America pauses to remember its fallen astronaut heroes and the great accomplishments for which they strived. @FLOTUS Melania and I mourn their passing and take to heart the lessons of their lives and the greater human potential to which they continue to inspire.

....The Dems and their committees are going ‚Äúnuts.‚Äù The Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt! 
So now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so. Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment....

I see Schumer is already criticizing my State of the Union speech, even though he hasn‚Äôt seen it yet. He‚Äôs just upset that he didn‚Äôt win the Senate, after spending a fortune, like he thought he would. Too bad we weren‚Äôt given more credit for the Senate win by the media! 
Tremendous numbers of people are coming up through Mexico in the hopes of flooding our Southern Border. We have sent additional military. We will build a Human Wall if necessary. If we had a real Wall, this would be a non-event! 
I am pleased to announce that David Bernhardt, Acting Secretary of the Interior, will be nominated as Secretary of the Interior. David has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived, and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed! 
With Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country, Republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for STRONG Border Security. Dems do nothing. If there is no Wall, there is no Security. Human Trafficking, Drugs and Criminals of all dimensions - KEEP OUT! 
Everyone is asking how Tiger played yesterday. The answer is Great! He was long, straight putted fantastically well. He shot a 64. Tiger is back will be winning Majors again! Not surprisingly, Jack also played really well. His putting is amazing! Jack Tiger like each other. 
I will be interviewed Sunday morning on @FaceTheNation and prior to the Super Bowl on @CBS at 3:30 P.M. Enjoy! 
Ed Gillespie, who ran for Governor of the Great State of Virginia against Ralph Northam, must now be thinking Malpractice and Dereliction of Duty with regard to his Opposition Research Staff. If they find that terrible picture before the election, he wins by 20 points! 
Democrat Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia just stated, ‚ÄúI believe that I am not either of the people in that photo.‚Äù This was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on ‚Äúsuper‚Äù late term abortion. Unforgivable!

....after 18 long years. Syria was loaded with ISIS until I came along. We will soon have destroyed 100% of the Caliphate, but will be watching them closely. It is now time to start coming home and, after many years, spending our money wisely. Certain people must get smart! 
I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan, the ‚ÄúEndless Wars‚Äù of unlimited spending and death. During my campaign I said, very strongly, that these wars must finally end. We spend $50 Billion a year in Afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace... 
This Witch Hunt must end! 
Nellie Ohr, the wife of DOJ official Bruce Ohr, was long ago investigating for pay (GPS Fusion) members of my family, feeding it to her husband who was then giving it to the FBI, even though it was created by ousted discredited Christopher Steele. Illegal! WITCH HUNT 
Just out: The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. They were made to friends business associates of Don. Really sad! 
Our great U.S. Border Patrol Agents made the biggest Fentanyl bust in our Country‚Äôs history. Thanks, as always, for a job well done! 
....I would suggest you read the COMPLETE testimony from Tuesday. A false narrative is so bad for our Country. I value our intelligence community. Happily, we had a very good meeting, and we are all on the same page! 
Just concluded a great meeting with my Intel team in the Oval Office who told me that what they said on Tuesday at the Senate Hearing was mischaracterized by the media - and we are very much in agreement on Iran, ISIS, North Korea, etc. Their testimony was distorted press.... 
Very sadly, Murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017, to 33,341. This is a big contributor to the Humanitarian Crisis taking place on our Southern Border and then spreading throughout our Country. Worse even than Afghanistan. Much caused by DRUGS. Wall is being built! 
Schumer and the Democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with Iran. They have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our Country. Iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and Iran Deal termination. Dems put us in a bad place - but now good! 
Looking for China to open their Markets not only to Financial Services, which they are now doing, but also to our Manufacturing, Farmers and other U.S. businesses and industries. Without this a deal would be unacceptable! 
More troops being sent to the Southern Border to stop the attempted Invasion of Illegals, through large Caravans, into our Country. We have stopped the previous Caravans, and we will stop these also. With a Wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive. Being Built! 
Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion, high taxes, Open Borders and Crime! 
Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time. Democrats, despite all of the evidence, proof and Caravans coming, are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I‚Äôve got you covered. Wall is already being built, I don‚Äôt expect much help! 
....China‚Äôs representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal, leaving NOTHING unresolved on the table. All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully resolved. Tariffs on China increase to 25% on March 1st, so all working hard to complete by that date! 
....meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in the Oval Office. No final deal will be made until my friend President Xi, and I, meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points. Very comprehensive transaction.... 
China‚Äôs top trade negotiators are in the U.S. meeting with our representatives. Meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides. China does not want an increase in Tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal. They are correct. I will be...... 
With Murders up 33% in Mexico, a record, why wouldn‚Äôt any sane person want to build a Wall! Construction has started and will not stop until it is finished. @LouDobbs @foxandfriends 
Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL! 
Large sections of WALL have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go. Renovation of existing WALLS is also a very big part of the plan to finally, after many decades, properly Secure Our Border. The Wall is getting done one way or the other! 
So great to watch listen to all these people who write books talk about my presidential campaign and so many others things related to winning, and how I should be doing ‚ÄúIT.‚Äù As I take it all in, I then sit back, look around, say ‚Äúgee, I‚Äôm in the White House, they‚Äôre not! 
....Large protests all across Venezuela today against Maduro. The fight for freedom has begun! 
Spoke today with Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaido to congratulate him on his historic assumption of the presidency and reinforced strong United States support for Venezuela‚Äôs fight to regain its democracy.... 
Dow just broke 25,000. Tremendous news! 
....a source of potential danger and conflict. They are testing Rockets (last week) and more, and are coming very close to the edge. There economy is now crashing, which is the only thing holding them back. Be careful of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school! 
The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong! When I became President Iran was making trouble all over the Middle East, and beyond. Since ending the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal, they are MUCH different, but....

If the committee of Republicans and Democrats now meeting on Border Security is not discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier, they are Wasting their time! 
...Time will tell what will happen with North Korea, but at the end of the previous administration, relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen. Now a whole different story. I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un shortly. Progress being made-big difference! 
....Fighting continues but the people of Afghanistan want peace in this never ending war. We will soon see if talks will be successful? North Korea relationship is best it has ever been with U.S. No testing, getting remains, hostages returned. Decent chance of Denuclearization... 
When I became President, ISIS was out of control in Syria running rampant. Since then tremendous progress made, especially over last 5 weeks. Caliphate will soon be destroyed, unthinkable two years ago. Negotiating are proceeding well in Afghanistan after 18 years of fighting.. 
Maduro willing to negotiate with opposition in Venezuela following U.S. sanctions and the cutting off of oil revenues. Guaido is being targeted by Venezuelan Supreme Court. Massive protest expected today. Americans should not travel to Venezuela until further notice. 
‚ÄúOur economy, right now, is the Gold Standard throughout the World.‚Äù @IngrahamAngle So true, and not even close! 
A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction. He pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer. He signed a non-disclosure agreement. He is a mess! 
How does Da Nang Dick (Blumenthal) serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee when he defrauded the American people about his so called War Hero status in Vietnam, only to later admit, with tears pouring down his face, that he was never in Vietnam. An embarrassment to our Country! 
In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can‚Äôt last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you! 
‚ÄúIn the Media‚Äôs effort to destroy the President, they are actually destroying themselves. Given all of the tremendous headwinds this President has faced, it‚Äôs amazing he has accomplished so much.‚Äù DEROY MURDOCK @foxandfriends I agree! 
Howard Schultz doesn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúguts‚Äù to run for President! Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the ‚Äúsmartest person.‚Äù Besides, America already has that! I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower! 
Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible. Starting to make a turn back? Great! 
Tariffs on the ‚Äúdumping‚Äù of Steel in the United States have totally revived our Steel Industry. New and expanded plants are happening all over the U.S. We have not only saved this important industry, but created many jobs. Also, billions paid to our treasury. A BIG WIN FOR U.S. 
After all that I have done for the Military, our great Veterans, Judges (99), Justices (2), Tax Regulation Cuts, the Economy, Energy, Trade MUCH MORE, does anybody really think I won‚Äôt build the WALL? Done more in first two years than any President! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Never thought I‚Äôd say this but I think @johnrobertsFox and @GillianHTurner @FoxNews have even less understanding of the Wall negotiations than the folks at FAKE NEWS CNN NBC! Look to final results! Don‚Äôt know how my poll numbers are so good, especially up 19% with Hispanics?

VOTER FRAUD ALERT: The @TXsecofstate discovered approx 95,000 individuals identified by DPS as non-U.S. citizens have a matching voter registration record in TX, approx 58,000 of whom have voted in TX elections. Any illegal vote deprives Americans of their voice. 
Thank you to Brit. This is a very big deal in Europe. Fake News is the Enemy of the People! 
Strong people stand up for themselves‚Äîbut stronger people stand up for others. Thank you President @realDonaldTrump for standing up for America. 
Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, just stated that because of me NATO has been able to raise far more money than ever before from its members after many years of decline. It‚Äôs called burden sharing. Also, more united. Dems Fake News like to portray the opposite! 
We are not even into February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. Cost Friday was $603,331,392. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our Country. So ridiculous! DHS 
58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote. These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. All over the country, especially in California, voter fraud is rampant. Must be stopped. Strong voter ID! @foxandfriends 
WITCH HUNT! 
WITCH HUNT! 
....about all of the one sided Fake Media coverage (collusion with Crooked H?) that I had to endure during my very successful presidential campaign. What about the now revealed bias by Facebook and many others. Roger Stone didn‚Äôt even work for me anywhere near the Election! 
CBS reports that in the Roger Stone indictment, data was ‚Äúreleased during the 2016 Election to damage Hillary Clinton.‚Äù Oh really! What about the Fake and Unverified ‚ÄúDossier,‚Äù a total phony conjob, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary to damage me and the Trump Campaign? What... 
‚ÄúAx falls quickly at BuzzFeed and Huffpost!‚Äù Headline, New York Post. Fake News and bad journalism have caused a big downturn. Sadly, many others will follow. The people want the Truth! 
Only fools, or people with a political agenda, don‚Äôt want a Wall or Steel Barrier to protect our Country from Crime, Drugs and Human Trafficking. It will happen - it always does! 
BUILD A WALL CRIME WILL FALL! 
‚ÄúWe absolutely need a physical barrier or Wall, whatever you want to call it. The President yesterday laid all that out. We need to do it all, including the Wall. I provided the same information to the previous administration, it was ignored.‚Äù Mark Morgan, Border Chief for ‚ÄúO‚Äù! 
Thank you to the Republican National Committee, (the RNC), who voted UNANIMOUSLY yesterday to support me in the upcoming 2020 Election. Considering that we have done more than any Administration in the first two years, this should be easy. More great things now in the works! 
We have turned away, at great expense, two major Caravans, but a big one has now formed and is coming. At least 8000 people! If we had a powerful Wall, they wouldn‚Äôt even try to make the long and dangerous journey. Build the Wall and Crime will Fall! 
21 days goes very quickly. Negotiations with Democrats will start immediately. Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in. The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border through dialogue. We will build the Wall! 
‚ÄúI like the fact that the President is making the case (Border Security Crime) to the American people. Now we know where Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer the Democrats stand, which is no Border Security. Will be big 2020 issue.‚Äù Matt Schlapp, Chair, ACU. Bigger than anyone knows! 
If Roger Stone was indicted for lying to Congress, what about the lying done by Comey, Brennan, Clapper, Lisa Page lover, Baker and soooo many others? What about Hillary to FBI and her 33,000 deleted Emails? What about Lisa Peter‚Äôs deleted texts Wiener‚Äôs laptop? Much more! 
I wish people would read or listen to my words on the Border Wall. This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it‚Äôs off to the races! 
Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION! Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better. Who alerted CNN to be there? 
A third rate conman who interviewed me many years ago for just a short period of time has been playing his biggest con of all on Fake News CNN. Michael D‚ÄôAntonio, a broken down hack who knows nothing about me, goes on night after night telling made up Trump stories. Disgraceful! 
Great earnings coming out of Stock Market. Too bad Media doesn‚Äôt devote much time to this! 
Nancy just said she ‚Äújust doesn‚Äôt understand why?‚Äù Very simply, without a Wall it all doesn‚Äôt work. Our Country has a chance to greatly reduce Crime, Human Trafficking, Gangs and Drugs. Should have been done for decades. We will not Cave! 
Without a Wall there cannot be safety and security at the Border or for the U.S.A. BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL! 
...back home where they belong, no more Rockets or M‚Äôs being fired over Japan or anywhere else and, most importantly, no Nuclear Testing. This is more than has ever been accomplished with North Korea, and the Fake News knows it. I expect another good meeting soon, much potential! 
The Fake News Media loves saying ‚Äúso little happened at my first summit with Kim Jong Un.‚Äù Wrong! After 40 years of doing nothing with North Korea but being taken to the cleaners, with a major war ready to start, in a short 15 months, relationships built, hostages remains.... 
So interesting that bad lawyer Michael Cohen, who sadly will not be testifying before Congress, is using the lawyer of Crooked Hillary Clinton to represent him - Gee, how did that happen? Remember July 4th weekend when Crooked went before FBI wasn‚Äôt sworn in, no tape, nothing? 
The economy is doing great. More people working in U.S.A. today than at any time in our HISTORY. Media barely covers! @foxandfriends 
‚ÄúThis is everything FDR dreamed about, the New Deal to put America back to work. Think of LBJ, he gave people food stamps welfare. Donald Trump‚Äôs giving them a job. He‚Äôs got a lot of good things to talk about. News stories do not accurately cover him, should correct.‚Äù @DougWead

The citizens of Venezuela have suffered for too long at the hands of the illegitimate Maduro regime. Today, I have officially recognized the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaido, as the Interim President of Venezuela. 
BUILD A WALL CRIME WILL FALL! 
BUILD A WALL CRIME WILL FALL! This is the new theme, for two years until the Wall is finished (under construction now), of the Republican Party. Use it and pray! 
Great unity in the Republican Party. Want to, once and for all, put an end to stoppable crime and drugs! Border Security and Wall. No doubt! 
Deroy Murdock, National Review: ‚ÄúWe are now exporting oil, which is the first time in my lifetime - we are right now the largest producer of oil and gas. This is not good if you‚Äôre Vladimir Putin where your chief export is oil. W.H. Agent - Not good for Kremlin.‚Äù @TuckerCarlson

The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the ‚Äúpodium‚Äù much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press. I told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway! Most will never cover us fairly hence, the term, Fake News! 
The United States has a great economic story to tell. Number one in the World, by far! 
Last time I went to Davos, the Fake News said I should not go there. This year, because of the Shutdown, I decided not to go, and the Fake News said I should be there. The fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them! 
Never seen @senatemajldr and Republicans so united on an issue as they are on the Humanitarian Crisis Security on our Southern Border. If we create a Wall or Barrier which prevents Criminals and Drugs from flowing into our Country, Crime will go down by record numbers! 
Marist/NPR/PBS Poll shows President Trump‚Äôs approval rating among Latinos going to 50%, an increase in one year of 19%. Thank you, working hard! 
FBI top lawyer confirms ‚Äúunusual steps.‚Äù They relied on the Clinton Campaign‚Äôs Fake Unverified ‚ÄúDossier,‚Äù which is illegal. ‚ÄúThat has corrupted them. That has enabled them to gather evidence by UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS, and that‚Äôs what they did to the President.‚Äù Judge Napolitano 
Without a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security. With a powerful Wall or Steel Barrier, Crime Rates (and Drugs) will go substantially down all over the U.S. The Dems know this but want to play political games. Must finally be done correctly. No Cave! 
‚ÄúThe Democrats are playing politics with Border Security.‚Äù @foxandfriends 
Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be. They have captivated the attention of the world, and I know they will use it for the good - maybe even to bring people together. It started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream! 
I want to show other celebrities who voted for @realDonaldTrump it‚Äôs ok to come forward. Better yet let‚Äôs show the world how many Americans stand with him. Bullies shouldn‚Äôt be allowed for almost a year and a half to bully us without cause. If you voted for him just Like or RT 
Looking like Nick Sandman Covington Catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false - smeared by media. Not good, but making big comeback! ‚ÄúNew footage shows that media was wrong about teen‚Äôs encounter with Native American‚Äù @TuckerCarlson 
Democrats are kidding themselves (they don‚Äôt really believe it!) if they say you can stop Crime, Drugs, Human Trafficking and Caravans without a Wall or Steel Barrier. Stop playing games and give America the Security it deserves. A Humanitarian Crisis! 
Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country. 26 people killed on the Border in a drug and gang related fight. Two large Caravans from Honduras broke into Mexico and are headed our way. We need a powerful Wall! 
If Nancy Pelosi thinks that Walls are ‚Äúimmoral,‚Äù why isn‚Äôt she requesting that we take down all of the existing Walls between the U.S. and Mexico, even the new ones just built in San Diego at their very strong urging. Let millions of unchecked ‚Äústrangers‚Äù just flow into the U.S. 
China posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies. Makes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!

The historic results of President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs first two years in office: 
Honored to serve as @POTUS Trump‚Äôs Vice President these past two years, working to deliver historic results for the American people - an economic boom, rolling back red tape, rebuilding our military restoring American leadership on the world stage. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT! 
A truly great First Lady who doesn‚Äôt get the credit she deserves! 
Thanks James! 
So many accomplishments from @realDonaldTrump and his administration over the past two years! 
TODAY - @SenatorEnzi Welcomed new @BudgetGOP members @SenatorBraun, @SenRickScott and @SenKevinCramer 
Will do a fantastic job! 
The president outlined a compromise proposal to strengthen border security end the partial government shutdown. Read my statement here: 
This proposal, which incorporates provisions similar to legislation I introduced earlier this month with @SenRobPortman, includes widely supported solutions that both sides of the aisle agree on. Congress must consider this proposal with a real sense of urgency. 
The President offered a reasonable compromise today to reopen the remainder of the government, and I look forward to considering it in the Senate. My statement here: 
It is true and I'm glad to stand with you on this @realDonaldTrump. The Democrats need to come to the table so we can secure our borders and #BuildTheWall. 
This is the latest and most significant step yet of POTUS showing his willingness to negotiate and compromise with Democrats on the issue of wall funding. At this point, if Democrats refuse to come to the table, it will show they are not at all serious about solving this impasse. 
My statement on @POTUS‚Äôs proposal to end the shutdown: 
@POTUS offers to support 2 bills sponsored by Dems (TPS DACA extensions)in exchange for Border Security (something Democrats claim to support) the immediate response from Dem leaders is No? I hope rank file D‚Äôs don‚Äôt go along with this strategy of unreasonable obstruction 
My statement on the President‚Äôs proposal to end the partial government #shutdown through a compromise on border security funding and protections for #DACA and TPS recipients. 
.@POTUS has laid out a constructive new proposal that contains the basis for a bipartisan agreement. It includes many of the same ideas I have been discussing in bipartisan talks over the past few weeks 
Today @POTUS proposed a common sense plan to secure our border, reopen our government, and KEEP AMERICANS SAFE. Now it‚Äôs time for Congress to work together to solve the crisis on our Southern Border and end the shutdown. Let‚Äôs get to work! 
A fantastic proposal Mr. President! Let's get it done! 
I support President @realDonaldTrump's plan. I will absolutely vote for this proposal when @senatemajldr brings up the bill next week. 
President Trump again spoke directly to the American people about the national security crisis at our southern border. @POTUS has listened to both sides is still willing to compromise. All members of Congress should take this proposal seriously. 
I strongly support President Trump‚Äôs immigration proposal today. Pelosi Schumer rejected it even before the president spoke to the nation made his proposal. They‚Äôre radical know-nothings. Let‚Äôs hope some... 
President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government. The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching. 
‚ÄúI commend the President for his leadership in proposing this bold solution to reopen the government, secure the border, and take bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues." -@senatemajldr 
Spot on. 
Breaking: A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll shows Hispanic-Latino approval of President Donald Trump‚Äôs job performance jumped 19 points in the past month, hitting, hitting 50% in January Hispanics want LEGAL immigration and a wall! 
The Media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with North Korea. Think of where we were at the end of the Obama Administration compared to now. Great meeting this week with top Reps. Looking forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at end of February! 
Thank you David! 
Don‚Äôt forget, we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly, and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building, after all, is what I do best, even when money is not readily available! 
Wow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall. 
Nancy, I am still thinking about the State of the Union speech, there are so many options - including doing it as per your written offer (made during the Shutdown, security is no problem), and my written acceptance. While a contract is a contract, I‚Äôll get back to you soon! 
Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the ‚Äúlefties‚Äù in her party that she has lost control...And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting! 
No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful Nancy! 
Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak. They don‚Äôt see crime drugs, they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country allow people to go back to work. 
Be careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn‚Äôt be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now! 
Always heard that as President, ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about the economy!‚Äù Well, we have one of the best economies in the history of our Country. Big GDP, lowest unemployment, companies coming back to the U.S. in BIG numbers, great new trade deals happening, more. But LITTLE media mention! 
I will be live from the White House at 4:00 P.M. 
Mexico is doing NOTHING to stop the Caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the United States. We stopped the last two - many are still in Mexico but can‚Äôt get through our Wall, but it takes a lot of Border Agents if there is no Wall. Not easy! 
Many people are saying that the Mainstream Media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election lead-up), as highlighted by the disgraceful Buzzfeed story the even more disgraceful coverage! 
The Economy is one of the best in our history, with unemployment at a 50 year low, and the Stock Market ready to again break a record (set by us many times) - all you heard yesterday, based on a phony story, was Impeachment. You want to see a Stock Market Crash, Impeach Trump! 
.@newtgingrich just stated that there has been no president since Abraham Lincoln who has been treated worse or more unfairly by the media than your favorite President, me! At the same time there has been no president who has accomplished more in his first two years in office! 
Will be leaving for Dover to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our Country! 
Fake News is truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! 
This is just the most egregious example of the rampant unfairness that has tainted this partisan witch-hunt from the beginning. The utter hatred for @realDonaldTrump has empowered a legion of back stabbers wielding flamboyant falsehoods to undermine @POTUS. 
At what point in fairness-after 2 years do Americans of good will say enough already? If the #SpecialCounsel had collusion don‚Äôt you think we would have heard it by now? This is history‚Äôs longest running smear job. Free @realDonaldTrump Reflect. Negotiate. Open the government. 
Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited ‚ÄúDossier,‚Äù paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats (as opposition research), on which the entire Russian probe is based! A very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country! 
By the time their fake news campaigns are fully exposed they‚Äôve already moved on to their next fake news campaign. A global real estate developer contemplating developing global real estate is just a desperate attempt to create their latest Trump scandal du jour. #MAGA 
The Buzzfeed bombshell bombed. It blew up in their face and the rest of the fake news are casualties too. 
The reporters never saw the evidence. They went off of a source who said it was ‚Äúcredible‚Äù. This isn‚Äôt journalism. Congratulations, Buzzfeed and CNN are head to head on the Fake News award. 
The entire premise of this story, which received wall-to-wall coverage, was based on "evidence" the reporters admitted they never even saw. Who could've predicted that the publishers of the phony dossier would get this wrong, too? 
This is just one of many fake news stories over the last several years. Sad so many journalists have lost their integrity. I hope @cnn and @msnbc step up and call this for what it is. 
Latino Job Approval of Trump SURGES in Midst of Govt Shutdown Over Border Wall Funding 
When are we going to start investigating the REAL collusion scandal? The collusion between the Clinton Obama teams and foreign governments in the scheme to spy on the Trump team is the real scandal.

We called it. FAKE NEWS! ‚ÄúMore Buzzfeed B.S.‚Äù 
I told you all that the BuzzFeed story was nonsense. 
Just a son who loves his Dad. Nice!

AMERICA FIRST! 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Never seen the Republican Party so unified. No ‚ÄúCave‚Äù on the issue of Border and National Security. A beautiful thing to see, especially when you hear the new rhetoric spewing from the mouths of the Democrats who talk Open Border, High Taxes and Crime. Stop Criminals Drugs now! 
Kevin Corke, @FoxNews ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget, Michael Cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud, and as recently as this week, the Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars....‚Äù Lying to reduce his jail time! Watch father-in-law! 
Another big Caravan heading our way. Very hard to stop without a Wall! 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Democrats keeping everything closed.‚Äù @JimInhofe So true! 
Why would Nancy Pelosi leave the Country with other Democrats on a seven day excursion when 800,000 great people are not getting paid. Also, could somebody please explain to Nancy her ‚Äúbig donors‚Äù in wine country that people working on farms (grapes) will have easy access in!

‚ÄúIn 2018 alone, 20,000 illegal aliens with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the Border, and there was a 122% increase in fentanyl being smuggled between ports of entry. Last month alone, more than 20,000 minors were smuggled into the U.S.‚Äù @seanhannity 
Thank you to Amy Kremer, Women for Trump Co-Founder, for doing such a great interview with Martha MacCallum...and by the way, women have the lowest unemployment numbers in many decades - at the highest pay ever. Proud of that! 
For decades, politicians promised to secure the border, fix our trade deals, bring back our factories, get tough on China, move the Embassy to Jerusalem, make NATO pay their fair share, and so much else - only to do NOTHING (or worse).... 
....I am doing exactly what I pledged to do, and what I was elected to do by the citizens of our great Country. Just as I promised, I am fighting for YOU! 
@realDonaldTrump They are eaten alive by hate for our President his voters! They care more about illegal immigrants than they do for American citizens! Look no further than CA re-directing money away from US citizens to illegal immigrants. Thank you for putting America 1st Mr. President 
So funny to watch Schumer groveling. He called for the firing of bad cop James Comey many times - UNTIL I FIRED HIM! 
The Left has become totally unhinged. They no longer care what is Right for our Countrty! 
It is becoming more and more obvious that the Radical Democrats are a Party of open borders and crime. They want nothing to do with the major Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border. #2020! 
There are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world, with 45 countries planning or building Walls. Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful. Stop the crime at our Southern Border! 
Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House. Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid), over 1000 hamburgers etc. Within one hour, it was all gone. Great guys and big eaters! 
Congratulations @ClemsonFB! 
Why is Nancy Pelosi getting paid when people who are working are not? 
We must stand with the rule of law against the coup targeting @RealDonaldTrump. 
For the first time in a generation, we have a president who is beginning to tell the truth about the crisis on the border. @RealDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch 
So...by the FBI's post-Trump standards for C.I. investigations, would this off-mike exchange between Obama Putin's deputy (where Obama offers Putin "more flexibility" on NATO missile defense in Europe) be grounds for opening an espionage probe of Obama? 
BREAKING: Inspector General Michael Horowitz still does NOT have all of Peter Strzok's and Lisa Page's texts, even though a third-party software vendor contracted to the FBI knows where all the missing data is saved 
GREAT AGAIN: Prior to 2018, unemployment has only been below 4% 5 times since 1970 Under Donald Trump, in 2018, unemployment dipped below 4% 7 TIMES‚Äîin ONE year! What exactly are the Democrats resisting? ü§î 
No one accused Obama of being a Russian agent after he asked for ‚Äúmore flexibility‚Äù until after the the election, or when Obama ignored Putin‚Äôs invasion into Crimea, or when Assad used chemical gas in Syria and Obama‚Äôs red line was crossed

I trust a rancher on the Southern border more than a liberal politician from Northern California 
Polls are now showing that people are beginning to understand the Humanitarian Crisis and Crime at the Border. Numbers are going up fast, over 50%. Democrats will soon be known as the Party of Crime. Ridiculous that they don‚Äôt want Border Security! 
A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras. Tell Nancy and Chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown! 
Volkswagen will be spending 800 million dollars in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They will be making Electric Cars. Congratulations to Chattanooga and Tennessee on a job well done. A big win! 
Just announced that Veterans unemployment has reached an 18 year low, really good news for our Vets and their families. Will soon be an all time low! Do you think the media will report on this and all of the other great economic news? 
The rank and file of the FBI are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about Lyin‚Äô James Comey and the so-called ‚Äúleaders‚Äù of the FBI. Twelve have been fired or forced to leave. They got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation. Bad!

Spoke w/ President Erdogan of Turkey to advise where we stand on all matters including our last two weeks of success in fighting the remnants of ISIS, and 20 mile safe zone. Also spoke about economic development between the U.S. Turkey - great potential to substantially expand!

President Trump Delivers Remarks at the American Farm Bureau Federation's 100th Annual Convention 
Getting ready to go on stage at the #AFBF100 in New Orleans - packed house! I will try and match the great game played yesterday by the New Orleans Saints and their incredible QB, Drew Brees. People here are very excited by the team. Going on stage now! 
The Fake News gets crazier and more dishonest every single day. Amazing to watch as certain people covering me, and the tremendous success of this administration, have truly gone MAD! Their Fake reporting creates anger and disunity. Take two weeks off and come back rested. Chill! 
‚ÄúDems in Puerto Rico as Shutdown hits day 24.‚Äù @foxandfriends 
Nancy and Cryin‚Äô Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault! 
I‚Äôve been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured! 
Smugglers are flooding our communities with drugs. *300 Americans die each week from heroin, 90% of it comes from south of the border. *ICE seized 2,370 lbs of fentanyl in 2017, enough to kill every American. Democrats need to work with @realDonaldTrump to secure our border. 
Economic policies that @realDonaldTrump and @IvankaTrump have championed are producing some fantastic results for America‚Äôs young women. The labor participation divide between millennial men and women is the lowest it‚Äôs ever been! 
Based on the record, the allegation/suggestion that the #FBI came close to investigating @realDonaldTrump as a Russian spy/asset-if true-says more about anti-Trump bias within the DOJ than it ever does about the president‚Äôs actions regarding Russia. 
Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are not negotiating in good faith with @realDonaldTrump. Instead, Congressional Democrats spent the weekend on the beach with lobbyists. It‚Äôs time for them to get back to Washington and work to secure our border and reopen the government. 
It didn't get the attention it deserved, but @realDonaldTrump recently signed a bill into law that will empower women all over the world. @IvankaTrump was instrumental in making the #WEEEAct a priority. Another huge success for the Trump admin! 
‚ÄúGas prices drop across the United States because President Trump has deregulated Energy and we are now producing a great deal more oil than ever before.‚Äù @foxandfriends But this is bad news for Russia, why would President Trump do such a thing? Thought he worked for Kremlin? 
....Border is eventually going to be militarized and defended or the United States, as we have known it, is going to cease to exist...And Americans will not go gentle into that good night. Patrick Buchanan. The great people of our Country demand proper Border Security NOW! 
The Trump portrait of an unsustainable Border Crisis is dead on. ‚ÄúIn the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with Criminal Records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes 4000 violent killings.‚Äù America‚Äôs Southern.... 
Best line in the Elizabeth Warren beer catastrophe is, to her husband, ‚ÄúThank you for being here. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here‚Äù It‚Äôs their house, he‚Äôs supposed to be there! 
If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash! 
So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better more responsible hands! 
....Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia, Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria - natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS! 
Starting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms. Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds. Create 20 mile safe zone.... 
Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden. Really is something - SPECIAL COUNTRY, SPECIAL PLACE! 
Thousands of illegal aliens who have committed sexual crimes against children are right now in Texas prisons. Most came through our Southern Border. We can end this easily - We need a Steel Barrier or Wall. Walls Work! John Jones, Texas Department of Public Safety. @FoxNews 
The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington! 
I‚Äôm in the White House, waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking! 
The building of the Wall on the Southern Border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire Country! 
Democrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and don‚Äôt want to include in talks. Many Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side, watch! 
I will be interviewed by Jeanine Pirro at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Watch @JesseBWatters before and @greggutfeld after. All terrific people. I am in the White House waiting for Cryin‚Äô Chuck and Nancy to call so we can start helping our Country both at the Border and from within! 
We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their ‚Äúvacations‚Äù and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign! 
....I do have a plan on the Shutdown. But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences! 
I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is ‚Äúchaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.‚Äù The Fakes always like talking Chaos, there is NONE. In fact, there‚Äôs almost nobody in the W.H. but me, and... 
Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes! Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man. Tell them to get it done! Humanitarian Crisis. 
23% of Federal inmates are illegal immigrants. Border arrests are up 240%. In the Great State of Texas, between 2011 2018, there were a total of 292,000 crimes by illegal aliens, 539 murders, 32,000 assaults, 3,426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges. Democrats come back! 
Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown, while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border. I am in the White House waiting for you! 
Lyin‚Äô James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the ‚Äúinsurance policy?‚Äù This is it!

I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time, as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again! 
.....who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, the 13 Angry Democrats - leaking machines who have NO interest in going after the Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton, her Campaign, and the Democratic National Committee. Just Watch! 
....the FBI was in complete turmoil (see N.Y. Post) because of Comey‚Äôs poor leadership and the way he handled the Clinton mess (not to mention his usurpation of powers from the Justice Department). My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop...... 
...Funny thing about James Comey. Everybody wanted him fired, Republican and Democrat alike. After the rigged botched Crooked Hillary investigation, where she was interviewed on July 4th Weekend, not recorded or sworn in, and where she said she didn‚Äôt know anything (a lie),.... 
Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason with no proof, after I fired Lyin‚Äô James Comey, a total sleaze! 
.@CNN called a San Diego news station (@KUSINews) for negative reports on the Wall. When the station said that Walls work, CNN no longer had interest. #FakeNews 
Drug prices declined in 2018, the first time in nearly half a century. During the first 19 months of my Administration, Americans saved $26 Billion on prescription drugs. Our policies to get cheaper generic drugs to market are working! 
I look forward to hosting, right out of the great State of South Carolina, the 2019 NCAA Football Champion Clemson Tigers at the White House on Monday, January 14th. What a game, what a coach, what a team! 
This is common sense. Congress must pass a bill that ends the crisis at our border. 
This afternoon, President Trump hosted a roundtable discussion with State, local, and community leaders, who spoke on how the crisis at the border is negatively impacting communities across our Nation. 
The Fake News Media keeps saying we haven‚Äôt built any NEW WALL. Below is a section just completed on the Border. Anti-climbing feature included. Very high, strong and beautiful! Also, many miles already renovated and in service! 
...The Steel Barrier, or Wall, should have been built by previous administrations long ago. They never got it done - I will. Without it, our Country cannot be safe. Criminals, Gangs, Human Traffickers, Drugs so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold! 
Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. I just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand, an invasion! I have been there numerous times - The Democrats, Cryin‚Äô Chuck and Nancy don‚Äôt know how bad and dangerous it is for our ENTIRE COUNTRY.... 
H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship. We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S. 
I often said during rallies, with little variation, that ‚ÄúMexico will pay for the Wall.‚Äù We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico. It is Billions of Dollars a year better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces. The difference pays for Wall many times over! 
When I took the Oath of Office.... 
We lose 300 Americans a week, 90% of which comes through the Southern Border. These numbers will be DRASTICALLY REDUCED if we have a Wall! 
Will be interviewed at the Border by @seanhannity on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00. Enjoy! 
Dear Diary... 
From the Southern Border.... 
Why do we need border security? This is why. These are the facts. #SecureOurBorder 
Because of the Democrats intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation, I am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. My warmest regards and apologies to the @WEF! 
President Obama, thank you for your great support ‚Äì I have been saying this all along! 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Texas! #MAGA 
‚ÄúGreat support for Border Security and the Wall.‚Äù @foxandfriends Even greater than anyone would know! ‚ÄúPresidents supporters do not want him to cave.‚Äù @SteveDoocy I won‚Äôt! 
There is GREAT unity with the Republicans in the House and Senate, despite the Fake News Media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise. The Opposition Party the Dems know we must have Strong Border Security, but don‚Äôt want to give ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù another one of many wins! 
Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I ‚Äúslammed the table walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum.‚Äù Because I knew he would say that, and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security, I politely said bye-bye and left, no slamming!

Governor Ron DeSantis suspends the horrible Sheriff Scott Israel who is largely responsible for the errors leading up to Parkland Shooting A man of action, on his first day going after the cowards of Broward! 
Did you know: At our Southern Border, in 2018: 1.7 MILLION pounds of narcotics were seized 17,000 criminals were arrested 6,000 gang members‚Äîincluding violent MS-13 Animals‚Äîwere apprehended Protect America - BUILD THE WALL 
President Trump is winning this shutdown fight Democrats have no message, and are refusing to open government because they are fighting for foreign nationals that want to flow endlessly into our country Stand your ground President Trump, we have your back! 
This is why we need a wall Illegal immigration is a serious threat to our country 90% of all heroin comes across the border Thousands of kids are Sex trafficked Illegals cost US taxpayers $135 billion a year We support the shutdown for a wall! RT! 
Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon, somewhat of a White House tradition or custom, to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers! 
The Mainstream Media has NEVER been more dishonest than it is now. NBC and MSNBC are going Crazy. They report stories, purposely, the exact opposite of the facts. They are truly the Opposition Party working with the Dems. May even be worse than Fake News CNN, if that is possible! 
Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works! 
Thank you to all of America's brave police, deputies, sheriffs, and federal law enforcement on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day! We love you and will always support you. 
Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives money! 
Our Country is doing so well in so many ways. Great jobs numbers, with a record setting December. We are rebuilding our military. Vets finally have Choice Accountability. Economy GDP are strong. Tax Reg cuts historic. Trade deals great. But we MUST fix our Southern Border! 
Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience! 
Congratulations to a truly great football team, the Clemson Tigers, on an incredible win last night against a powerful Alabama team. A big win also for the Great State of South Carolina. Look forward to seeing the team, and their brilliant coach, for the second time at the W.H. 
Talks with China are going very well! 
‚ÄúThe President is the biggest and best supporter of the Steel Industry in many years. We are now doing really well. The Tariffs let us compete. Was unfair that the Steel Industry lost its jobs to unfair trade laws. Very positive outcome.‚Äù Mark Glyptis, United Steelworkers 
Economic numbers looking REALLY good. Can you imagine if I had long term ZERO interest rates to play with like the past administration, rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today. That would have been SO EASY! Still, markets up BIG since 2016 Election! 
Endless Wars, especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago, those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing, will eventually come to a glorious end! 
I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern. 
The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria. No different from my original statements, we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!..... 
Congressman Adam Smith, the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, just stated, ‚ÄúYes, there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. It‚Äôs been done a number of times.‚Äù No doubt, but let‚Äôs get our deal done in Congress! 
....The Fake News Media in our Country is the real Opposition Party. It is truly the Enemy of the People! We must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting! 
...The Fake News will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the Trump Administration, and me, look as bad as possible. They use non-existent sources write stories that are total fiction. Our Country is doing so well, yet this is a sad day in America! 
With all of the success that our Country is having, including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts, the Fake News totally dishonest Media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse. Many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the TRUTH!... 
V.P. Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives today. Many details of Border Security were discussed. We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger less obtrusive. Good solution, and made in the U.S.A. 
Our GREAT MILITARY has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole. We have just killed the leader of that attack, Jamal al-Badawi. Our work against al Qaeda continues. We will never stop in our fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism! 
Excited to see our friends in Egypt opening the biggest Cathedral in the Middle East. President El-Sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future! 
How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%? 
As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they can‚Äôt win in 2020, too much success! 
....The only reason they do not want to build a Wall is that Walls Work! 99% of our illegal Border crossings will end, crime in our Country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year! A properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year! 
‚ÄúWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked...‚Äù Barrack Obama, 2005. I voted, when I was a Senator, to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in...‚Äù Hillary Clinton, 2015. 
Will be going to Camp David tomorrow morning for meetings on Border Security and many other topics with @WhiteHouse senior staff. 
AP-NORC POLL: ‚ÄúImmigration among the top concerns in 2019.‚Äù People want to stop drugs and criminals at the Border. Want Border Security! Tell the Dems to do the inevitable now, rather than later. The wait is costly and dangerous! 
‚ÄúThe number of employed Americans has now set a 14th record under President Trump. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by 84 cents, or 3.2%. Participation Rate hits Trump-Era High.‚Äù CNS NEWS. And we will do even better with new trade deals and all else! 
‚ÄúJobs up big, plus 312,000. Record number working. Manufacturing best in 20 years (Previous administration said this could not happen). Hispanic unemployment lowest ever. Dow plus 747 (for day).‚Äù @DRUDGE_REPORT 
V.P. Mike Pence and team just left the White House. Briefed me on their meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives. Not much headway made today. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border! 
Drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing. Not being fair to the consumer, or to our Country! 
‚ÄúFormer @NYTimes editor Jill Abramson rips paper's ‚Äòunmistakably anti-Trump‚Äô bias.‚Äù Ms. Abramson is 100% correct. Horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write. Hence the term Fake News, Enemy of the People, and Opposition Party! 
Great Tweet today by Tyler Q. Houlton @SpoxDHS on the #FakeNews being put out by @CNN, a proud member of the Opposition Party. @TSA is doing a great job! 
The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid, but they don‚Äôt want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out! 
We are working hard at the Border, but we need a WALL! In 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized, 17,000 adults arrested with criminal records, and 6000 gang members, including MS-13, apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem. 
I don‚Äôt care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats, I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go, where are the Dems? 
Many people currently a part of my opposition, including President Obama the Dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine settled. While no big deal, I did not commit a campaign violation! 
The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! This would be so easy to do! 
Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)! 
Thank you to Kanye West for your nice words. Criminal Justice Reform is now law - passed in a very bipartisan way! 
Great new book by Dr. Robert Jeffress, ‚ÄúChoosing the Extraordinary Life.‚Äù Get it and enjoy! @LouDobbs 
The story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. I‚Äôm sure he is a fine man, but I don‚Äôt know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job! 
‚ÄúJob growth surges by 312,000 in December‚Äù

Michael Pillsbury interviewed by @cvpayne: ‚ÄúThey have the motive of making the President look bad ‚Äì instead of President Trump being portrayed as a HERO. The first President to take China on, it‚Äôs 20 years overdue.... 
The RNC has a great Chairwoman in Ronna McDaniel and the @GOP has never been stronger. We achieved historic wins with her help last year! #MAGA 
The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on. At some point this had to be done! 
The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can‚Äôt win based on all of the achievements of ‚ÄúTrump,‚Äù so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!

Sadly, there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall! 
...I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let‚Äôs get it done! 
Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people ‚Äì this is the first and most important duty of government... 
Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback! 
Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn‚Äôt. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player WIN! 
For FAR TOO LONG Senate Democrats have been Obstructing more than 350 Nominations. These great Americans left their jobs to serve our Country, but can‚Äôt because Dems are blocking them, some for two years-historic record. Passed committees, but Schumer putting them on hold. Bad! 
Do you think it‚Äôs just luck that gas prices are so low, and falling? Low gas prices are like another Tax Cut! 
‚ÄúKim Jong Un says North Korea will not make or test nuclear weapons, or give them to others - he is ready to meet President Trump anytime.‚Äù PBS News Hour. I also look forward to meeting with Chairman Kim who realizes so well that North Korea possesses great economic potential! 
Washington Examiner - ‚ÄúMAGA list: 205 ‚Äòhistoric results‚Äô help Trump make case for 2020 re-election.‚Äù True! 
Gas prices are low and expected to go down this year. This would be good! 
Border Security and the Wall ‚Äúthing‚Äù and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let‚Äôs make a deal? 
Congratulations to President @JairBolsonaro who just made a great inauguration speech - the U.S.A. is with you! 
One thing has now been proven. The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring! 
‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù McChrystal got fired like a dog by Obama. Last assignment a total bust. Known for big, dumb mouth. Hillary lover! 
....Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other Administration in history. These are people who have been approved by committees and all others, yet Schumer continues to hold them back from serving their Country! Very Unfair! 
Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer is not approving their otherwise approved Ambassadors!? Likewise in Government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from.... 
.@realDonaldTrump made sure the men and women of the Coast Guard continue to get paid during the #SchumerShutdown. Meanwhile, Democrats refuse to work with our president to enhance border security. 
Jobless claims fell last week to a 49-year low. Yet another sign that @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs economic policies are working and America‚Äôs workforce is thriving. 
The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border! 
Happy New Year! 
HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA! 2019 WILL BE A FANTASTIC YEAR FOR THOSE NOT SUFFERING FROM TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. JUST CALM DOWN AND ENJOY THE RIDE, GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR OUR COUNTRY! 
Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a very good and talented guy, has a great new book just out, ‚ÄúWhy We Fight.‚Äù Lots of insight - Enjoy! 
2018 has been a year of historic accomplishments! 
...Remember this. Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change. You have Walls and you have Wheels. It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way! Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL! 
The Democrats will probably submit a Bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security, namely the Wall. You see, without the Wall there can be no Border Security - the Tech ‚Äústuff‚Äù is just, by comparison, meaningless bells whistles... 
MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal, the USMCA, that will replace the horrendous NAFTA Trade Deal, which has so badly hurt our Country. Mexico Canada will also thrive - good for all! 
HAPPY NEW YEAR! 
....Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other Administration in history. These are people who have been approved by committees and all others, yet Schumer continues to hold them back from serving their Country! Very Unfair! 
Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer is not approving their otherwise approved Ambassadors!? Likewise in Government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from.... 
It‚Äôs incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn‚Äôt work. It does, and properly built, almost 100%! They say it‚Äôs old technology - but so is the wheel. They now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying! 
I‚Äôm in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes, but with me in office, I‚Äôll get it built, and Fast! 
I am the only person in America who could say that, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bringing our great troops back home, with victory,‚Äù and get BAD press. It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever, they would still be unhappy! 
I campaigned on Border Security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall. Our Southern Border has long been an ‚ÄúOpen Wound,‚Äù where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country. Dems should get back here an fix now! 
.....Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be! I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS, remember! 
...I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places. Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me my tactics, which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do! 
If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero. ISIS is mostly gone, we‚Äôre slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants...... 
An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me! 
President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version! 
Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown. No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans! 
Veterans on President Trump‚Äôs handling of Border Security - 62% Approval Rating. On being a strong leader - 59%. AP Poll. Thank you! 
‚ÄúIt turns out to be true now, that the Department of Justice and the FBI, under President Obama, rigged the investigation for Hillary and really turned the screws on Trump, and now it looks like in a corrupt illegal way. The facts are out now. Whole Hoax exposed. @JesseBWatters 
‚ÄúAbsolutely nothing‚Äù (on Russian Collusion). Kimberley Strassel, The Wall Street Journal. The Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics. The only Russian Collusion was with Hillary and the Democrats! 
2018 is being called ‚ÄúTHE YEAR OF THE WORKER‚Äù by Steve Moore, co-author of ‚ÄúTrumponomics.‚Äù It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the ‚Äúbest job market in 50 years, and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers. Big wage gains.‚Äù 
For those that naively ask why didn‚Äôt the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year, it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES, and they will gives us ‚ÄúNONE‚Äù for Border Security! Now we have to do it the hard way, with a Shutdown. Too bad! @FoxNews 
...children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol. The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadn‚Äôt given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard getting so little credit! 
Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They can‚Äôt. If we had a Wall, they wouldn‚Äôt even try! The two..... 
Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made! 
I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security. From what I hear, they are spending so much time on Presidential Harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military! 
The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19,000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover, Agent Peter S. These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax. This is a total Obstruction of Justice. All Texts Demanded! 
Thank you to Sean Parnell for the nice comments on @foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to Melania and I in Iraq and Germany. Great things are happening! 
.....Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years! 
.....close the Southern Border. Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs. Go back to pre-NAFTA, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico. Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border...... 
....The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a ‚Äúprofit making operation.‚Äù We build a Wall or..... 
We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress President who would approve! 
CNN others within the Fake News Universe were going wild about my signing MAGA hats for our military in Iraq and Germany. If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, I will sign. Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported! 
This isn‚Äôt about the Wall, everybody knows that a Wall will work perfectly (In Israel the Wall works 99.9%). This is only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump the Republicans have a win. They may have the 10 Senate votes, but we have the issue, Border Security. 2020! 
Brad Blakeman: ‚ÄúThe American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. The President says look, this is your neighborhood, you‚Äôve got to stand up to protect yourselves. Don‚Äôt always look to America.‚Äù 
I totally agree! 
There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall! 
‚ÄúBorder Patrol Agents want the Wall.‚Äù Democrat‚Äôs say they don‚Äôt want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they don‚Äôt want ICE. They don‚Äôt have much to campaign on, do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity! 
The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn‚Äôt get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case. After ruling, Dems dropped deal - and that‚Äôs where we are today, Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall. 
The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall, where they almost all recently agreed it should be built, is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years, a U.S. record! 
Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking,Gang Members Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats? 
Just returned from visiting our troops in Iraq and Germany. One thing is certain, we have incredible people representing our Country - people that know how to win! 
.@FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to visit our incredible troops at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. GOD BLESS THE U.S.A.! 
I hope everyone, even the Fake News Media, is having a great Christmas! Our Country is doing very well. We are securing our Borders, making great new Trade Deals, and bringing our Troops Back Home. We are finally putting America First. MERRY CHRISTMAS! #MAGA 
Helping children across the country track #Santa is becoming one of my favorite traditions! @Potus and I enjoyed working with @NORADSanta - #ChristmasEve 
I am in the Oval Office just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas. We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall, some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of Dollars, lives, will be saved! 
Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea ‚Äì Progress being made. Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim! 
I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy! 
Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. See? Isn‚Äôt it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A! 
The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is, without the Wall, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted! 
I never ‚Äúlashed out‚Äù at the Acting Attorney General of the U.S., a man for whom I have great respect. This is a made up story, one of many, by the Fake News Media! 
The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don‚Äôt have a feel for the Market, they don‚Äôt understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can‚Äôt score because he has no touch - he can‚Äôt putt! 
AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN! 
For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember, he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker. 
....We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S., and our TAXPAYERS, on Trade. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed! 
To those few Senators who think I don‚Äôt like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO. What I don‚Äôt like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade... 
Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence. It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it. Desperately needed! 
President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria....and he is a man who can do it plus, Turkey is right ‚Äúnext door.‚Äù Our troops are coming home! 
‚ÄúThe President has been remarkable. I do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment, and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is.‚Äù Thank you to Tammy Bruce and Steve Hilton. Presidential Harassment has been with me from the beginning! 
The most important way to stop gangs, drugs, human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border. We need Border Security, and as EVERYONE knows, you can‚Äôt have Border Security without a Wall. The Drones Technology are just bells and whistles. Safety for America! 
Mitch McConnell just told a group of people, and me, that he has been in the U.S. Senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best most productive of his career. Tax Regulation Cuts, VA Choice, Farm Bill, Criminal Justice Reform, Judgeships much more. Great! 
‚ÄúIt should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world. This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq, that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades, and he‚Äôs right...The generals still don‚Äôt get the mistake.‚Äù @RandPaul 
Thanks @RandPaul ‚ÄúI am very proud of the President. This is exactly what he promised, and I think the people agree with him. We‚Äôve been at war too long and in too many places...spent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere. He‚Äôs different...that‚Äôs why he got elected.‚Äù 
.....Bob Corker was responsible for giving us the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, which I ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home. Bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. I said NO and the game was over. #MAGA I LOVE TENNESSEE! 
Senator Bob Corker just stated that, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so priveledged to serve in the Senate for twelve years, and that‚Äôs what I told the people of our state that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do, serve for two terms.‚Äù But that is Not True - wanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldn‚Äôt endorse him..... 
We signed two pieces of major legislation this week, Criminal Justice Reform and the Farm Bill. These are two Big Deals, but all the Fake News Media wants to talk about is ‚Äúthe mistake‚Äù of bringing our young people back home from the Never Ending Wars. It all began 19 years ago! 
Unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in Indonesia. More than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for. We are praying for recovery and healing. America is with you! 
I just had a long and productive call with President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey. We discussed ISIS, our mutual involvement in Syria, the slow highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area. After many years they are coming home. We also discussed heavily expanded Trade. 
I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019. Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, previously Boeing. He will be great! 
The only way to stop drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements and much else from coming into our Country is with a Wall or Barrier. Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works! 
When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn‚Äôt, I thought I should. Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S. 
If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America. With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy! 
Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event! 
I will not be going to Florida because of the Shutdown - Staying in the White House! #MAGA 
Senate adjourns until December 27th. 
I won an election, said to be one of the greatest of all time, based on getting out of endless costly foreign wars also based on Strong Borders which will keep our Country safe. We fight for the borders of other countries, but we won‚Äôt fight for the borders of our own! 
The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall. Let work begin! 
Will be having lunch in White House residence with large group concerning Border Security. 
....going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left. When I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We‚Äôre coming home! 
I am in the White House, working hard. News reports concerning the Shutdown and Syria are mostly FAKE. We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security (Gangs, Drugs, Human Trafficking more) but it could be a long stay. On Syria, we were originally... 
OUR GREAT COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY! 
Wishing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a full and speedy recovery! 
Some of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now. Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America‚Äôs Southern Border!

If they really cared about fixing the hydro mess, the gov would ditch the (un)Fair Hydro Plan, not give it a new coat of paint. This is $4 billion every year to subsidize energy use - money that could be much better spent on health care and education.

Happy to confirm that is all correct. 
Very kind of you. thanks! 
A friend just emailed to remind me, I had been awake for 12 hours before voting started, so I have been working 33 hours "today." The Calendar on the Table in the chamber stays at March 20. Just a really loooong day, #cdnpoli #SNCLavalin 
So I've been voting for 21 hours now. The leader here the least is Scheer. Last vote was 95-44, so less than half of MPs are here. I support getting answers on #SNCLavalin but this will not work. #GPC #cdnpoli

Always something to look forward to. :) @kady 
@ElizabethMay Very possibly true, yes. Although no sign of slow-voting yet. 
Keep all that enthusiasm for the election campaign @GuelphGreens and bring it home. Good luck to all the candidates. @CanadianGreens 
I fear as we get back to daylight hours, we'll have many more MPs and the pace will slow. @kady 
Hey @AndrewScheer Why aren‚Äôt you in the House voting? You triggered this. The least you could do is be present. Not a good showing. @CPC_HQ 
Could be another 24 hours or so. We are on vote 32 out of 196 votes. Of course it takes less time with only 20 #CPC MPs. :) #GPC @kady 
@ElizabethMay So how long will it take to get through the remaining votes with those numbers? Seems to be about 4 minutes per vote at the moment. 
Being a lone MP, I don't get breaks. But I do sympathize. It is hard on everyone. 
He has hardly been here at all. Come to think of it, I am the only leader who has been here all night. #GPC @kady 
Bit of a Royal We being employed here, as Scheer doesn't seem to be in the House at the moment. Not sure when he clocked out. And no, neither is the prime minister, but as it was Scheer's party that triggered this vote-a-thon, you'd think he'd stick it out for the duration. 
About 12 years ago I spoke at the World Bank about the security threats of climate change and US military bases at risk. It is clear here that not just coastal bases are threatened by flooding! The military has understood this for years!

The impacts of #climatechange will cost hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars -- and we're seeing them now. But the worst impacts will be in the poorest regions without the infrastructure emergency response capabilities of the rich. This is #climate injustice.

@SenateCA @StephanieCarvin @IntrepidPodcast @NoFlyListKids I append to this string a note on follow up reactions to it: specifically, that my initial first tweet overstates the real risk of delay, and that there is no Conservative effort to delay. This is welcome news, thank you. / addendum 1 
@SenateCA @StephanieCarvin @IntrepidPodcast @NoFlyListKids Finally, I would be happy to learn that concerns communicated to me about delays are overstated, and that this is not a partisan issue. 
@SenateCA @StephanieCarvin @IntrepidPodcast @NoFlyListKids I could go on ‚Äî and will, every chance I get. But I am simply a private citizen, with a keyboard.

@SenateCA @StephanieCarvin @IntrepidPodcast C-59 doesn‚Äôt solve every dilemma.

@SenateCA @StephanieCarvin @IntrepidPodcast For 16 years, I have been studying and writing on Cdn national security laws. In that period, the policy and legal dilemmas have become harder, the threat environment more complex than at any time in our recent history. /7

We should never get used to the President of the United States resorting to personal attacks on political oppenents, like this. It debases the cultural debate and reflects so poorly on the leadership. I know this is just one of many issues, but it still should not be acceptable.

May: If we make a single amendment to this bill, it will kill it. Tens of thousands of Canadians want to see this bill passed and we need to do it. 
May says it is hard to think of another bill that has been studied more. Over 17 meetings in the Senate and 30 meetings. ‚ÄúTime for study is over, the time for passing is now.‚Äù

Why won‚Äôt Andrew Scheer attend a climate forum in his own riding, asks Elizabeth May 
Tough to stay "strong on the environment" while the Alberta wing of the party pushes for more pipelines, and the BC wing pushes for more fracking. @ThomasMulcair is right. Canadians are looking for, and deserve, a sure thing on the environment. 
This is where the conservative argument of anti-regulation falls apart. It completely fails to account for mega corporations like Monsanto who refuse to act in good faith. #monsanto #chemicals #cancer

#SNCLavalin scandal matters, but so does homelessness, lack of access to healthcare, the plight of Indigenous people, climate change, unemployment, the apathy of politicians and more. Here's what else we have to worry about: 
I agree, especially significantly the climate crisis is ignored. Still, the scales of importance tip a bit more toward serious when corporate crime and bribery are involved. The case needs to be heard - fully - in court. #GPC

@Pepperfire How do you think Cons knew how SNC-Lavalin's system operated? Most of the shenanigans happened under Harper: fraud, false contracts, etc. It was already a scandal back in 2009. Remember, it was all over QC's newspapers. Then Khadafi story came out in 2010.

4. The gov't announced plans (but never followed through) to create a Cdn Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise, to investigate accusations of wrongdoing by Cdn mining, energy, textile companies overseas. #cdnpoli #feminist 
3. Women in the international garment industry-many working for Cdn companies-continue to disproportionately face challenges including unsafe working conditions, low wages, and sexual abuse. #cdnpoli #feminism 
2. Trudeau has not pressed the mining industry to higher standards, despite promises to do so. Yet studies of the oil, gas mining industries make clear the severe gender bias in the benefits risks associated with resource extraction globally. #cdnpoli 
1. @JustinTrudeau's foreign policy #feminist rhetoric: the Feminist Int'l Assistance Policy was to allocate 15% of Cda's $2.6B development assistance to support gender equality, women girls by 2022. How's that working?

5/ Then, if a prosecutor decides the objective of jobs/pensions can be read into s.715(32)(2)(i) as an unstated factor, she still must balance that agst the categorical exclusion in s715(32)(3) of "national economic interest" as part of s.715(32)(2)(i)'s "any other factor[s]". 
6/ 715(32)(3) reads: "Despite (2)(i) [any other factor], ... the prosecutor must not consider the national economic interest, the potential effect on relations with a state other than Canada or the identity of the organization or individual involved."

A global group of 415 investors managing $32 trillion in assets are warning that ignoring action against climate change could cause permanent economic damage up to four times the size of the 2008 financial crisis. #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround 
A surge in U.S. and Canadian oil production over the last decade has added the equivalent of ‚Äúone Russia or one Saudi Arabia‚Äù to the markets ‚Äî pushing the planet farther away from ever getting a grip on the pollution that is driving climate change.

9/ Finally, a reminder: PM believes he and his circle can pressure AG Lametti exactly as they did AG Wilson-Raybould. Unless Lametti blows the whistle, we will never know....But then, why wld he blow whistle, if he's ok with a culture and practice of internal pressuring of AG? 
8/ I really hope it's true, per Butts' testimony, that McLachlin was just example of kind of external jurist (bad as such a suggestion was). If overtures made to McLachlin to sound out willingness, that wld be added scandal. If they tried, I assume she'd tell them how improper. 
7/ Just as appalling, as I noted to CBC: "'What exactly did they think they were going to do? Get some kind of named jurist to come in and tutor the AG and her legal team? That felt really almost condescending." Change my softer "felt really almost" to "was". #cdnpoli 
6/ Further, 'asking' the AG to get external lawyer's opinion was clearly improper pressure. As UBC prof Martin notes: "[T]hat was just a way of govt saying: 'I'm going to bug u, until u say what I want.The only reason to suggest to get an outside opinion is that she's wrong.'" 
5/ Apart from dangers to rule of law of Trudeau's embracing of pressure on AG, there are practical reasons why AG must be deferential to prosecutor decisions: "No system can work with the AG constantly being on watch over multiple files as to whether they're going to intervene." 
4/ Further, under the Criminal Code remediation-agreement regime, if DPP changes decision to prosecute -- as she can -- and decides she wants to negotiate an agreement, THEN the Code gives AG a specific safeguard role whereby AG consent is needed for such negotiation. #cdnpoli 
3/ #SNCLavalin lawyers can -- but must only -- present fresh evidence to DPP, a) not to AG, b) least of all try to get to the AG via surrogate lobbyists inside govt, and c) even more improperly try to get to DPP via govt actors (as testimony revealed was considered). #cdnpoli 
2/ Bogus to claim AG must constantly revisit whether to intervene w/ DPP after already deciding not to intervene. It is DPP who has continual obligation to revisit prosecuting. PM system invites a) insider lobbying and b) logistical mess for justice system 
1/ CBC on AG David Lametti as ¬´ SNC-Lavalin's last hope to avoid prosecution ¬ª. Due to PM‚Äôs untenable view that constant political lobbying is not interference, ¬´ people can keep taking a run at the AG behind the scenes ¬ª, as I commented to CBC.

It‚Äôs been 30 HOURS and Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals are still voting just to hide their corruption cover-up scandal. Unbelievable! WATCH LIVE: 
STILL VOTING in the House of Commons. All he has to do is end the cover-up, and the filibuster will end. Will he? WATCH LIVE: 
Justin Trudeau is doing everything he can to keep the truth hidden from Canadians. We will keep pushing for him to come clean. 
Great chat tonight with @lraitt about why it's so important that Justin Trudeau let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak: 
The Liberal scandal continues! Conservatives are protesting Justin Trudeau‚Äôs cover-up. Watch the votes live: 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU IS EXPOSED: His main excuse for politically interfering in a criminal prosecution is completely fabricated. He literally made it up! SNC-Lavalin never said any jobs were in danger. Justin Trudeau has been exposed as a fraud and must resign. 
#ICYMI MP‚Äôs are still voting to end Justin Trudeau‚Äôs cover-up. WATCH NOW: 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs #CoverUpBudget borrows billions and billions of dollars to cover up his SNC-Lavalin corruption. Not only will his reckless coverup spending lead to tax hikes if he‚Äôs re-elected, it‚Äôs now affecting Canada‚Äôs credit rating. 
STILL VOTING in the House of Commons. Justin Trudeau must end his cover-up. Tune in: 
Past 6 p.m. in Ottawa. Just passed 24-hour mark in the voting marathon. Haven't yet missed a vote. Or won one. And yet, what a great day for our democracy, using the limited tools we have to hold this Liberal majority government to account. So proud of our @CPC_HQ team tonight.

The voting continues! Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals have continued to shut down investigations and interfere in the course of justice. Canadians deserve better. WATCH LIVE: 
What are they hiding? Liberal MP's would rather vote for almost 24 hours straight than allow the full story to be told. WATCH LIVE: 
I agree. Canadians deserve the truth. Justin Trudeau‚Äôs former Attorney General and former Treasury Board President are saying Canadians don‚Äôt have the full story yet. 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are STILL VOTING to protest Justin Trudeau‚Äôs corruption cover-up. Watch live from the House of Commons: 
Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals have kept this vote going for over 20 hours! They can end it now. Let her speak! WATCH: 
THE TRUTH MUST BE SO DAMAGING! Why else would Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals be working so hard to keep it hidden from Canadians? Why doesn‚Äôt Trudeau come clean? Canadians still deserve to know what happened. Trudeau must start being honest with Canadians. 
MPS ARE STILL VOTING. Tune in: 
Justin Trudeau is doing everything he can to cover-up his corruption scandal. He‚Äôs shut down investigations. He won‚Äôt let witnesses speak. He won‚Äôt honestly answer questions. Ending the filibuster is easy: come clean with Canadians. Be honest. End the corruption cover-up.

Almost 6 a.m. and we‚Äôve been #UpAllNight in the House of Commons so @JustinTrudeau can avoid having one of his own MPs tell the Justice Committee a story she feels needs to be told. How much longer will Liberal MPs delay the inevitable? #cdnpoli

Tensions are running high as the #Liberals unveiled their spending plan, with the opposition #Conservatives deciding to walk out of the House. We spoke to Conservative leader #AndrewScheer, with more on what he thought of #Budget2019. #cdnpoli 
Nothing in today‚Äôs budget can be taken seriously. Justin Trudeau is trying to bury the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal under $41 billion of new Liberal spending, which Canadians will pay for through higher taxes if he is re-elected. This is the most expensive cover-up in history. 
This is Justin Trudeau‚Äôs cover-up budget. He is trying to bury the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal under $41 billion of brand new Liberal spending, which Canadians will pay for through higher taxes if Trudeau is re-elected. 
Justin Trudeau promised the budget would be balanced this year. It‚Äôs not. Instead, he‚Äôs throwing around billions of dollars to distract from his corruption scandal cover-up. If he wins in October, Canadians will pay for it with higher taxes. #YourBudget2019 
Justin Trudeau is trying to bury the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal under $41 billion of brand new Liberal spending, which Canadians will pay for through higher taxes if he is re-elected. This is the most expensive cover-up in history. 
With Budget 2019, Justin Trudeau is covering up his corruption with $41 billion of brand new spending. His plan is clear: Big deficits to cover up corruption before the election. Big tax hikes to pay for them after. #CoverUpBudget 
Justin Trudeau has abused the power of his office to shut down the Justice Committee and cover up his corruption scandal. Justin Trudeau must end his cover-up and give Canadians the answers they deserve. Watch #QP Live: 
Corruption on top of corruption: Liberals have now shut down the Justice Committee. Instead of letting Jody Wilson-Raybould speak, Trudeau will introduce a sham budget from a Finance Minister who is also implicated in the corruption scandal. WATCH LIVE: 
It‚Äôs official. Justin Trudeau has shut down the SNC-Lavalin investigation and will keep Jody Wilson-Raybould silent, hoping Canadians won‚Äôt notice on budget day. This is corruption of the highest order and Conservatives won‚Äôt stand for it. 
Justin Trudeau has lawyered up. His Liberal MPs will shut down the Justice Committee. The only possible conclusion Canadians can reach is that Trudeau is engaged in a massive cover-up. 
Today is the day. Will Justin Trudeau let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak, or will he continue his corruption scandal cover-up? Canadians demand answers: #cdnpoli 
Send Justin Trudeau a message here: 2/2 
There we have it, Liberals will investigate Liberals to get to the bottom of Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Liberal Scandal. Justin Trudeau must do the right thing - let the former Attorney General complete her testimony. 1/2 
Jody Wilson-Raybould has more she wants to say. She wants Canadians to know the full truth. If the Trudeau Liberals won‚Äôt let her, Canadians can only conclude it‚Äôs because Trudeau wants to keep people in the dark. Speak out now: #cdnpoli 
Justin Trudeau has lawyered up. His Liberal MPs will shut down the Justice Committee. The only possible conclusion Canadians can reach is that Trudeau is engaged in a massive cover-up. 
The Justice Committee is meeting one more time Tuesday morning to give Justin Trudeau a chance to let his former Attorney General speak. Will he let her speak, or continue his corruption scandal cover-up? Have your say: #cdnpoli 
The Justice committee meets first thing tomorrow morning. It‚Äôs not too late for Justin Trudeau to waive full privilege so @Puglaas can finish her testimony on the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal. RT to tell him to #LetHerSpeak 
Two Ministers. His Principal Secretary. Now the Clerk of the Privy Council. All resigned amid Trudeau's scandal. And yet, Trudeau still says 'nothing to see here'. It‚Äôs time for Trudeau to start being honest with Canadians and unmuzzle the former AG: 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs corruption scandal has captured the attention of the global community. He‚Äôs now hired outside lawyers, and he continues to block his former Attorney General from speaking. He‚Äôs not behaving like an innocent man. WATCH #QP LIVE: 
.@CandiceBergenMP on Trudeau‚Äôs corruption cover-up: ‚ÄúTruly appalling that the Liberals continue protecting Justin Trudeau by covering up his involvement in the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal that has paralyzed his government.‚Äù Her full statement: #cdnpoli 
This is incredibly disappointing. Regulatory uncertainty, rising taxes, and billions in new debt is chasing away investment and the jobs that go with it. Canadians are paying for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes. 
Budget 2019 was supposed to be the year Justin Trudeau eliminated the deficit and balanced the budget. That was his promise in the 2015 election. That promise is now in tatters and the economic outlook is bleak. 
My message to young Canadians is simple: I‚Äôve learned age is just a characteristic; it‚Äôs not something that should prevent you from pursuing your dreams. Don‚Äôt ever let it hold you back. Watch my TEDx Talk: 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Carbon Tax officially takes effect in two weeks, increasing the cost of everything from groceries, to gasoline, to home heating. Canadians are being squeezed and they need some real relief. 
During the last election, Justin Trudeau promised the budget would balance itself by 2019. He is smashing that promise to spend borrowed money to distract from his own corruption scandal. #YourBudget2019 
Justin Trudeau will be using this week‚Äôs budget as a smokescreen for his corruption scandal. Canadians deserve better than a Prime Minister who uses their hard earned money as distraction from his cover-up. 
When Justin Trudeau said Canada was back, he clearly meant Canada‚Äôs Liberal corruption and scandals were back. The @nytimes lays out the details of Trudeau‚Äôs SNC-Lavalin scandal: 
Thank you to Imam Muhammad Suhel Sapa for welcoming me and allowing me to express my condolences to and solidarity with the Muslim community in the aftermath of the horrific mosque attacks in New Zealand. 
It was an honour to be welcomed by members of my hometown Regina‚Äôs local Muslim community at the Madni Islamic Centre Mosque today. All Canadians stand with our Muslim brothers sisters in the wake of the horrific terrorist attack on innocent people at prayer in New Zealand. 
Today is the fifth anniversary of Vladimir Putin's illegal invasion and annexation of Crimea. We have not forgotten it, nor will we accept it. Putin needs to get out of Ukraine. Conservatives stand with the Ukrainian people in their fight for sovereignty. 
Justin Trudeau continues to use his majority to cover up his involvement in his corruption scandal. Canadians continue to have legitimate questions about this scandal. Conservatives will continue to push to get answers and you can help by visiting 
Canadians are worried. They‚Äôre worried about having enough money left over at the end of the month, about having enough money to retire, or send their children to university, or visit their grandkids. Justin Trudeau must address this affordability crisis. 
Conservatives understand that heating your home is a necessity in Canada, not a luxury. That‚Äôs why as part of my plan to help Canadians get ahead, I‚Äôm going to take the tax the off your home heating and home energy bills. 
The OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) represents more than 30 countries and over 1 billion people. The world is watching Justin Trudeau‚Äôs corruption scandal. It‚Äôs time for him to let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak. Tell him: 
It‚Äôs hard enough to make ends meet, and so I am looking for ways to help Canadians get ahead. Helping you save on your home energy bills is just one measure that I will be putting forward to make sure Canadians keep more of their own money. 
Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are desperately trying to change the channel from the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal. Their next budget will be an attempt to distract Canadians with their own money. Don‚Äôt be fooled by these election-year gimmicks. 
Another week, another investigation into Trudeau‚Äôs government. 
My full statement on yesterday‚Äôs mosque attacks in New Zealand: 
There are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred. I am praying for peace for the families of those lost and recovery for those injured. 2/2 
Freedom has come under attack in New Zealand as peaceful worshippers are targeted in a despicable act of evil. All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear. 1/2 
Our country needs a leader who is proud to champion our energy workers and the prosperity they create. Conservatives have a plan to get projects built, to get Canadians working, and to help all Canadians get ahead. Let‚Äôs get it done. 
The Liberals are going to great lengths to cover-up Justin Trudeau‚Äôs corruption scandal, and they‚Äôre looking bad in the process. Just imagine how bad the truth must be if they‚Äôre willing to endure all this to hide it from Canadians. #LavScam #cdnpoli 
Part of my plan to get Canadian pipelines built is to ban foreign influence in the process. Decisions about Canadian projects must be made by Canadians, not foreign protesters. 
His failed infrastructure plan‚Ä¶ Yet another way Canadians are paying for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes. 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are proud to champion the men and women in our energy sector and all those who depend on them. We will bring investment back to Canada and create jobs and prosperity for all Canadians. 
Justin Trudeau has tried many excuses for his SNC-Lavalin scandal. This one, his favourite, seems like it was just made up. Canadians deserve to hear the truth. He needs to stop making up excuses and allow his former Attorney General to speak freely. 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are proud to champion the men and women in our energy sector and all those who depend on them. We will bring investment back to Canada and create jobs and prosperity for all Canadians. 
Justin Trudeau must come clean with Canadians about his corruption scandal and cover-up before he does more damage to our reputation around the world. 
The behaviour of the Trudeau Liberals on the Justice Committee is shocking. They‚Äôre continuing to cover up Justin Trudeau‚Äôs corruption scandal. It‚Äôs time for Canadians to finally know the truth. Sign:

On top of scrapping Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Carbon tax, I will take the GST off your home heating and energy bills. You shouldn‚Äôt have to pay tax on a necessity like heating your home. This is part of my plan to help Canadians get ahead. 
It‚Äôs time to let her speak, Justin Trudeau. These are the actions of a man with something to hide. 
Wishing you all the best Mayor Labeaume! 
Liberals used their majority to protect Trudeau and cover up his involvement in a corruption scandal. They shut down the committee refused to allow the former Attorney General to testify. These are the actions of a man with something to hide. Statement: 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU‚ÄôS COVER-UP CONTINUES: Instead of allowing Jody Wilson-Raybould to tell the whole story, Liberals on the Justice Committee just used their majority to shut the committee down. They even ran out the back door. Canadians must hear the truth:

SHOCKING: Watch as Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals shut down the Justice Committee and cover up Justin Trudeau‚Äôs involvement in his SNC-Lavalin scandal. They refuse to let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak. 
Justice committee live: Members of the Justice Committee are debating now whether to let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak. Tell Justin Trudeau he must let her speak: 
Trudeau tried to subvert the rule of law to win elections benefit his friends. Today the Justice Committee will decide if they‚Äôre going to call the former Attorney General back to complete her testimony. Tell him to waive full solicitor-client privilege: 
It‚Äôs about time Canadians stopped paying tax on a necessity like home heating. I made a big announcement this week and spoke with families about how taking the tax off their home energy bills will help their family budgets. 
Justin Trudeau continues to censor Ms. Wilson-Raybould, refusing to waive the full solicitor-client privilege that prevents her from telling her side of the story. Justin Trudeau must waive full solicitor client privilege and let her speak. Have your say: 
Justin Trudeau isn‚Äôt letting Jody Wilson-Raybould speak freely and complete her testimony on the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Canadians deserve answers. Trudeau must stop blocking his former Attorney General from telling the full story. Help send him the message: 
Canada is facing a moral and ethical crisis of leadership. Justin Trudeau needs to let the former Attorney General speak by waiving full solicitor-client privilege. An important letter from @lraitt to members of the Justice Committee. 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs main excuse for the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal has been debunked. It was never about jobs. It was about helping Liberals win seats and reward friends. Trudeau must waive full privilege and let his former Attorney General speak:

The eyes of the world are on Justin Trudeau‚Äôs corruption scandal. His political interference in SNC-Lavalin‚Äôs criminal prosecution has undermined our rule of law to the point that our allies are now flagging Canada for corrupt practices. He must resign.

From @AndrewScheer: SNC-Lavalin scandal has exposed the 'real Justin Trudeau' 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are focused on helping local businesses to grow, create jobs and fuel our economy. We want to help Canadians get ahead, instead of just getting by. 
Canola farmers like Brian and Doug are seeing their entire livelihoods put at risk because China has decided to block their canola from being imported. This is a baseless action against our Canola farmers who produce the highest quality canola in the entire world. 
I want to help all Canadians have the opportunity to get ahead, so parents can see their children prosper ‚Äì just like my parents did for my sisters me. Taking the tax off your home heating bill is part of that plan, because heating your home isn‚Äôt a luxury. #TaxFreeHomeHeating 
Justin Trudeau is focused on his political survival instead of the Canadian economy and jobs. Canadians deserve better. 
Canadian farmers just like Brian Chorney produce the highest quality canola in the world. But, because of Justin Trudeau‚Äôs failure on managing the Chinese relationship, China has unfairly stopped importing Canadian canola. Farmers are paying for Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes. 
It‚Äôs thanks to the trailblazers that came before us that my daughters Grace, Madeline and Mary have a bright future. Thank you to all the inspiring, strong talented women who joined me tonight to celebrate the accomplishments of women in the past and look forward to the future. 
Leaving more money in your pocket is part of my plan to help Canadians get ahead. You shouldn't have to pay tax on your home heating bill, so a Conservative government will give you tax-free home heating. WATCH LIVE from a family farm in Manitoba: 
I‚Äôm proud to be marking #InternationalWomensDay with our Conservative team. Celebrated for over a century, it‚Äôs a day to bring attention to the many achievements of women and girls and highlight the continued call to action for equality around the world: 
Canadians believe that in this country no dream should be out of reach and no ambition too big. In Kitchener tonight I took questions and spoke about how a Conservative government will help bring about that Canada, where people can get ahead instead of just getting by. 
Canadians are worried about Justin Trudeau‚Äôs SNC-Lavalin scandal the costs of his Carbon Tax. Happy to talk about my plan to take the tax off home heating with @DamatoRecord from @WR_Record and make life more affordable. Thanks for the beer Hespeler Brewing Ernies Road House! 
The PM PCO pressure on the AG is NOT just "something that happens" in govt. The foundation of CA's democracy is separation of executive the judiciary to ensure the independence preservation of the rule of law. We must protect defend this principle. 
The seriousness and severity of what is at stake for our country cannot be overstated. Over the last month Canadians have witnessed Justin Trudeau corrupt the very rule of law and try in vain to cover it up. The truth cannot be ‚Äúexperienced differently." 
A true community hero. Congrats, Chief Heisler and thank you for keeping our community safe. 
While Justin Trudeau makes life more expensive with his tax plan, I‚Äôm focused on making life more affordable. I will scrap his Carbon Tax. 
Taking the GST off home heating bills and scrapping Justin Trudeau's Carbon Tax are just two ways that Canada‚Äôs Conservatives will help make life more affordable for Canadians. WATCH LIVE from Kitchener: 
When Canadians have access to the opportunities they need to succeed anything is possible. The creators behind @ClearpathRobots have shown this. It‚Äôs entrepreneurs like Matt Rendall, Bryan Webb and Ryan Gariepy that I want to help succeed and see their dreams become reality.

This afternoon @AndrewScheer spoke with the media in Toronto and responded to Justin Trudeau‚Äôs #lavscam press conference. #cdnpoli

1/2 - Today, Trudeau confirmed that he was behind the sustained and coordinated attempt to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution of #SNCLavalin. 
There is a such thing as right and wrong, and real leaders know the difference between them. In refusing to take responsibility for the SNC-Lavalin Affair, Justin Trudeau is blaming the system. I‚Äôm speaking LIVE with the media right now: 
While I completely agree with the @PPSC_SPPC, it is very troubling that Justin Trudeau‚Äôs actions and attempts at interference have made such a statement necessary. Justin Trudeau has endangered the rule of law in Canada and must resign. 
Mr. Trudeau today spoke of an ‚Äúerosion of trust.‚Äù On this, he is correct. The real erosion of trust in this whole affair is between Justin Trudeau and Canadians. His is a government that cannot be redeemed. It must be defeated. Conservatives are ready. 
What we heard from Justin Trudeau was an attempt to justify and normalize corruption. It‚Äôs clearer than ever that inside his government, political interference and contempt for the rule of law are a matter of course. This is a PM who has lost the moral authority to govern. 
I‚Äôm working to make life more affordable for all Canadians. It can cost a lot to heat your home in the winter and I want to help you get ahead instead of just get by through introducing #TaxFreeHomeHeating in October. The latest part of my positive Conservative Plan for Canada: 
Conservatives know that Justin Trudeau's taxes are making it harder for Canadians to get by. Making your home heating tax-free is the newest part of our positive Conservative vision to help Canadians get ahead. 
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm among many loyal @Jeopardy viewers who are shocked by this news. To Alex Trebek: know that the prayers of millions of people around the world, including from my family, are with you as you face this challenge head-on. All the best. 
We don‚Äôt want to live in a Canada where the laws are applied differently just because of who you know in the government. @lraitt is right on here, and the appalling response from Trudeau‚Äôs government should worry all Canadians 
Heating your home is expensive and puts a strain on seniors with fixed incomes. A Conservative government will take the tax off your home heating bill, as part of my plan to help Canadians get ahead. WATCH LIVE from Quebec City: #TaxFreeHomeHeating 
While Justin Trudeau is focused on his political survival, Canada‚Äôs economy takes a turn for the worse. Canadians need a fresh new government that can address our economic challenges head on.

It‚Äôs hard enough to get ahead these days without the government taxing you on basic essentials. That‚Äôs why today I‚Äôm announcing the next step in my plan to make life more affordable for Canadians by removing the GST from your energy bills. #TaxFreeHomeHeating 
Heating your home in the winter isn‚Äôt a luxury for Canadians, it is a necessity. I want to help Canadians get ahead, not just get by. Canadians should have a government that helps people achieve their dreams and doesn't stand in their way. #TaxFreeHomeHeating 
Just finished announcing the next part of my positive Conservative vision for Canada: taking the tax off of your home heating bill. Happy to answer YOUR questions about this and other topics now. Join in: #TaxFreeHomeHeating 
Keeping your house warm in the winter isn‚Äôt a luxury. That‚Äôs why a Conservative Government will take the tax off your home heating bill. It‚Äôs part of my plan to help Canadians get ahead. WATCH my announcement LIVE from Mississauga: #TaxFreeHomeHeating 
Millions of Christians here at home and around the world will gather today on Ash Wednesday to begin the season of Lent. On behalf of Canada‚Äôs Conservatives, please accept my wishes for a blessed Ash Wednesday. My statement: 
People who are telling the truth don‚Äôt change their story every couple days. Let‚Äôs debunk Justin Trudeau‚Äôs various excuses for his SNC-Lavalin scandal. 
Canada's Conservatives will always stand up against antisemitism here and around the world. I reiterated this yesterday when I spoke with @bnaibrithcanada, w/ @KentThornhillMP @LindaFrum. We discussed plans for #ASaferCanada and for a fair and compassionate immigration system. 
The Prime Minister‚Äôs abruptly canceled trip to Regina to hype his unpopular carbon tax shows a Liberal government in complete chaos. #cdnpoli #skpoli #yqr 
It shouldn‚Äôt take: 4 weeks of denials, 3 committee hearings, 2 cabinet ministers resigning and 1 focus-grouped apology for a prime minister to take responsibility. 
While Justin Trudeau is embroiled in scandal, Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are focused on helping Canadians get ahead. Stay tuned for an important announcement tomorrow! 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives have a proud record of protecting the world's most vulnerable, particularly women and girls. Yesterday I talked about this record and how our future Conservative government will build on that record with Canadian international development leaders. 
Proud of @Marty_Morantz, our Conservative candidate in Charleswood‚ÄîSt. James‚ÄîAssiniboia‚ÄîHeadingley for the work he is already doing in the community. He will be a strong voice for them in Ottawa. 
Thanks for your service to Canadians, our shared home province of Saskatchewan and your community @DavidAndersonSK! Your passion and hard work to advance human rights around the world is an inspiration across our country. You‚Äôll be missed! Wishing you all the best in retirement. 
Justin Trudeau has a tax plan that leaves Canadians worse off, not an environment plan. He‚Äôs trying to distract from his government in chaos and his refusal to answer Canadians‚Äô questions honestly. He must waive privilege, recall Parliament, and appear at the Justice Committee. 
Justin Trudeau cannot continue as PM given his unprecedented political interference in the course of justice. Last week, I said he had lost the moral authority to govern. Today, a senior member of his inner circle came to the same conclusion. My statement: 
Last week, I said Justin Trudeau had lost the moral authority to govern. Today, a senior member of his inner circle came to the same conclusion. Jane Philpott‚Äôs resignation clearly demonstrates a government in total chaos, led by a disgraced prime minister consumed with scandal. 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs government is in chaos. He wouldn‚Äôt allow the former Attorney General to speak freely, so we don‚Äôt know her full story. Trudeau‚Äôs story changes daily and won‚Äôt come clean with Canadians. He needs to fully cooperate with any RCMP investigations and resign. 
October is coming. 
Instead of defending the integrity of Canada‚Äôs justice system, Justin Trudeau was only protecting himself and his friends. He has betrayed the trust of Canadians and must resign. 
Canada should be a country where we are all equal under the law. Where nobody ‚Äì regardless of wealth, status, or political connections ‚Äì is above the law. I believe we can be that country again, but to do so, Justin Trudeau must resign. 
Family skiing day at @SkiVorlage! 
Justin Trudeau has failed to uphold the rule of law by conspiring to stop a criminal trial for a company charged with bribery. Justin Trudeau must resign. 
As former judge Turpel-Lafond says, Justin Trudeau‚Äôs actions have shaken the foundations of our justice system. He does not understand that the law applies to him and his friends. 
Justin Trudeau has lost credibility. He must fully cooperate with any RCMP investigations and resign. 
Lametti's answer gives Canadians a glimpse at how Justin Trudeau's government operates. If they can pull some lever of power to help them win an election, they will. Nothing is ever off limits. For Trudeau, politics is above the law. 2/2 
If you're the Attorney General and you're asked if elections are ever a reason to interfere in a court case, the answer should be "No." Watch David Lametti's pathetic answer to the easiest question he will ever get: 1/2 
‚ÄúCanada is back‚Äù in the @nytimes... 
Justin Trudeau has lost credibility. He keeps changing his story, he is contradicted by witnesses, is embroiled in chaos and scandal, and needs to resign. 
Hockey is ingrained in our culture and few represent that better than @NHLFlames Jarome Iginla. His accomplishments are countless: 1500+ NHL games, world junior gold, 3x Olympian with 2 golds, and assisting the Golden Goal. Iggy made his mark. We honour the legend that is #12. 
The details from the former Attorney General‚Äôs testimony are as shocking as they are corrupt. Justin Trudeau must understand that he can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation, and must resign. 
I was sickened and appalled by the former Attorney General‚Äôs story of inappropriate, and possibly illegal pressure on her by Justin Trudeau and his officials. Justin Trudeau must resign. 
Simple and direct. @TashaKheiriddin‚Äôs take on Justin Trudeau and the SNC-Lavalin Affair. 
Justin Trudeau has allowed his partisan political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. Former judge Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond said it well, Justin Trudeau has put Canada in a crisis. 
Justin Trudeau has lost the moral authority to govern. He should cooperate with any RCMP investigations and resign. 
Wish I could say I was surprised. He‚Äôs said no to a public inquiry. He‚Äôs said no to testifying at committee. He‚Äôs stopped the former AG from speaking freely. Now he‚Äôs saying no to even showing up to the House. He‚Äôs running away. 
Proof the former Attorney General was removed for saying no to Justin Trudeau. 
Sad reflection on Canada that it's come to this. Five former attorneys general have now also written the RCMP over Trudeau's behaviour. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. We can again have a country where criminal cases aren‚Äôt decided by who you know or how wealthy you are. 
This year marks the 100th anniversary of the proclamation of the Independence of Korea. Every year on March 1st, Korean-Canadians honour the Independence Movement and those who have given their lives for freedom:

Here we go again. *Noone* buys that @puglaas was not up to the job. In fact she withstood the pressure AND pushed back AND when punished she had the guts to report it all. But by all means keep going Liberals - bury yourselves further. 
Top 6 Liberal excuses for #LavScam Excuse 1: ‚ÄúWe did it to save jobs.‚Äù Fact: The pressure Justin Trudeau exerted on Jody Wilson-Raybould was only about protecting Liberal seats in Parliament. The only job he was trying to save was his own. 1/n 
Trudeau owes Canadians nothing less than full transparency in the SNC-Lavalin affair. Given severity and credibility of the allegations from the former Attorney General, @theJagmeetSingh and I call on him to recall the House next week so MPs can hold him to account. Our letter: 
Justin Trudeau no longer has the moral authority to govern. It was disgusting that he didn‚Äôt have the fortitude to answer any questions in Question Period yesterday. 
Worrying economic news this morning. We need a government that will start helping Canadians get ahead. Justin Trudeau‚Äôs government is in chaos and damage control, leaving Canadians to pay for his mistakes. 
Andrew Scheer calls for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs immediate resignation. RT if you agree. 
We don't want to live in a country where powerful companies can call politicians to pressure the attorney general to get them off the hook. We cannot let that happen. 
.@ToddDohertyMP and @JohnNaterMP are standing up for justice and demanding Justin Trudeau resign after trying to interfere in a criminal procceding. Watch LIVE now: 
After what we‚Äôve learned Justin Trudeau has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign. The RCMP must also immediately open an investigation into the examples of obstruction of justice by Mr. Trudeau. Canada should be a country where we are all equal under the law. 
I will be leading the Emergency Debate tonight around 6:15pm ET- watch on Facebook Live. Canada is in crisis, Trudeau needs to resign. #SNCLavalinScandal 
WATCH LIVE as @CandiceBergenMP and @michaelchongMP demand answers and a resignation from Justin Trudeau over his political interference scandal. 
Conservatives have more questions regarding the #SNCLavalinScandal. I intend to move these motions at the next Justice Committee meeting. 
Canadians just found out that Justin Trudeau is spending $200-million MORE of their taxpayer dollars on used Australia fighter jets bring the total to $1.09-billion!! 
These comments towards @Puglaas are misogynistic and repugnant. Justin Trudeau should denounce them right now. 
Justin Trudeau should be in the House to explain what part of yesterday‚Äôs testimony he claims are false and answer for his involvement in the SNC-Lavalin scandal, but he‚Äôs not. Justin Trudeau must resign. WATCH QUESTION PERIOD LIVE: 
Canadians can't have a PM who is willing to commit a crime to protect his political interests. We need the police to investigate these serious allegations and he should immediately resign and allow this investigation to take place. My letter to the RCMP: 
Q: What do you think of the PM again blaming Scott Brison and leaving the investigation to the Ethics Commissioner? A: That‚Äôs ridiculous. #cdnpoli #lavscam 
Some of today's headlines. What do you think? #cdnpoli #lavscam 
I‚Äôll be in Question Period today to ask Justin Trudeau direct questions. He must return to Ottawa immediately and directly answer the accusations he‚Äôs facing over his involvement in the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Will he? 
Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern given what he has done. He must resign. Official Opposition House Leader @CandiceBergenMP is calling for an emergency session on this in Parliament. Watch live: 
Right now in the House of Commons I will be asking for an emergency debate. Trudeau has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign. 
Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done. That is why I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. My statement: 
Justin Trudeau has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign. Speaking LIVE to the media right now: 
I‚Äôm wearing pink today for #PinkShirtDay to send the message that bullying should not be tolerated. Show kindness and wear pink to show those around you that you want to stop bullying for good! 
.@MikeBarrettON, no longer our newest MP, and I welcomed the newest addition to the @CPC_HQ team: MP-elect Scot Davidson @teamdavidson3! Great to have you at our caucus meetings this morning, Scot! 
Justin Trudeau is still silencing @Puglaas. She has more to say and he won‚Äôt let her say it. Canadians deserve answers. 
Former judge Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond says a politician trying to influence a criminal prosecution ‚Äúis not only immoral, but is illegal.‚Äù We know Justin Trudeau tried to do exactly that. 
What does Liberal and former Ontario Attorney General @MJ_Bryant say about Justin Trudeau‚Äôs efforts to stop SNC-Lavalin‚Äôs criminal trial from proceeding? ‚ÄúIt may be a crime.‚Äù It‚Äôs time for him to answer for this. 
Justin Trudeau is trying to trick Canadians into believing he is letting the former Attorney General speak freely, but, he is still hiding information he doesn‚Äôt want Canadians to know. Canadians deserve answers. WATCH QUESTION PERIOD LIVE: 
As @camrclark wrote, we know @Puglaas was under pressure to stop SNC-Lavalin‚Äôs criminal trial. That pressure came from Justin Trudeau. And he‚Äôs still keeping her silent about the whole thing. What is he hiding? 
Here‚Äôs @acoyne‚Äôs take on Justin Trudeau‚Äôs interference in SNC-Lavalin‚Äôs criminal prosecution: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ all sorts of pressure was applied‚Äù from the PM himself. No wonder he still won‚Äôt let @Puglaas speak freely and tell Canadians her full version of the story. 
Justin Trudeau is still silencing Jody Wilson-Raybould. He isn‚Äôt letting her speak about key details of the SNC-Lavalin Affair. This is unacceptable. I spoke with reporters this morning about why this is so serious on my way into our weekly Conservative caucus meetings. 
"Trudeau the prime minister has become a fraud. He is now on the run, trying his best to avoid the very things he once promised to champion. I will not let him get away with this." - @AndrewScheer #cdnpoli 
Justin Trudeau is misleading Canadians. His own order-in-council says clearly the former Attorney General cannot speak freely. Jody Wilson-Raybould has confirmed this herself. Justin Trudeau needs to start telling the truth and come clean with Canadians. 
SNC-Lavalin affair ‚Äì timeline of events: 2016 ‚Äì 2018 ‚Äì Hundreds of meetings between PMO, Minister‚Äôs senior political staff and SNC-Lavalin This includes former Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Gerald Butts, (1/n) 
Justin Trudeau can no longer hide the fact that he was at the centre of an attempt to interfere in a criminal prosecution. He must come clean with Canadians. 
When it came to political interference in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, Justin Trudeau just wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer. Canada‚Äôs Conservatives will keep working until we get to the bottom of this scandal. 
Today Jody Wilson-Raybould confirmed Trudeau is still preventing her from being able to fully explain her version of SNC-Lavalin affair events. He's trying to trick you into believing he's letting her speak freely. In reality he's still hiding something: 
Today my PMB C-417 passed a major hurdle towards passage w/ unanimous support of the #justicecommittee. My Bill will enable jurors to discuss all aspects of a trial w/ a mental health professional. Heartened by strong all-party support. Let‚Äôs get it passed! #MentalHealthMatters 
While Justin Trudeau many of his cabinet colleagues may be able to afford to set up companies buy villas to avoid taxes, most Cdns do not have the same options. Why keep paying for Liberal failure when Cdns can choose Conservative leadership to get ahead? #cdnpoli 
Conservatives call on Canada to extend and expand Operation UNIFIER to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine. 
I am confident Scot Davidson @teamdavidson3 will be a strong voice for York-Simcoe and I‚Äôd like to congratulate @jayshin2019 and @JasmineLouras, who proved that the Conservatives are a force to be reckoned with across the country. My statement: 2/2 
On behalf of the entire Conservative caucus, I‚Äôd like to thank and congratulate our three fantastic Conservative candidates and their teams. Yesterday‚Äôs results are proof once again that our positive Conservative vision is resonating with Canadians across the country. 1/2 
Justin Trudeau has failed to be open and transparent. His SNC-Lavalin cover-up continues, and Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals continue to block attempts to hear from Trudeau himself. WATCH QP LIVE: 
Interfering in a criminal proceeding is always wrong, Justin Trudeau. Helping get your well-connected friends off the hook isn't the way Canada works. Since he‚Äôs now also refusing to appear before the Justice Committee, we‚Äôll explore still more options to get Canadians answers. 
Yesterday, Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals blocked a Conservative call for him to testify publicly at the Justice Committee. He said it was the appropriate avenue for investigations and his refusal to testify is unacceptable. We're exploring options to get Canadians the answers they deserve. 
Justin Trudeau promised Canadians he would be different. He promised to be open and transparent. He promised a new era of accountability in government. Canadians took him at his word. He has betrayed them. 
Congratulations to the next MP for York‚ÄîSimcoe, Scot Davidson! Canadians can‚Äôt afford to keep paying for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes, and you‚Äôll be a strong voice in Ottawa to help your constituents get ahead. 
Canadians shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes. This weekend I was in Southern Ontario and York‚ÄîSimcoe with our candidate Scot Davidson talking to Canadians about how we can help create the opportunities that will help them get ahead. We‚Äôre fighting for you! 
UPDATE: The Trudeau Liberals just blocked our attempt to have Justin Trudeau appear publicly at the Justice Committee and answer questions. Canadians deserve answers, and our Conservative team is determined to get them. 
Today in the House of Commons I am calling on the Prime Minister to appear, testify and answer questions at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, under oath, for a televised two hour meeting before March 15th, 2019. VOTING NOW LIVE: 
In a couple hours, each Liberal MP will have to make a decision: do they help Justin Trudeau cover-up textbook government corruption, or do they stand with Canadians to find the truth in the SNC-Lavalin affair? Canadians will do well to remember how everyone votes tonight. 
Your vote can make the difference. It's important to get out and vote for @jayshin2019 today in Burnaby! 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs story on the SNC-Lavalin affair keeps changing and now it doesn‚Äôt match sworn testimony at the Justice Committee. He needs to answer Canadians‚Äô questions and commit to appear under oath at Justice committee. WATCH QP LIVE: 
Justin Trudeau must come clean and account for his actions. He must appear publicly at the Justice Committee to answer Canadians‚Äô questions. Watch my remarks in the House of Commons live: 
Canada is a country of the rule of law and nobody should be entitled to special treatment. What we‚Äôve seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption. Justin Trudeau must come clean. He must account for what he has done. 
It's an important day in Burnaby South, York--Simcoe, and Outremont! Make sure you get out and vote! 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are focused on helping you get ahead instead of just getting by. Today‚Äôs the day Burnaby South: Get out and vote for @JayShin2019! 
Justin Trudeau has been covering up his involvement in the SNC-Lavalin scandal. But I won‚Äôt let him get away with it. Canadians deserve answers and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm demanding Justin Trudeau publicly testify under oath at the Justice Committee. WATCH LIVE:

So much fun with the Portuguese community in Toronto at last night‚Äôs annual Accordion Festival in North York. What a party! 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs story on the SNC-Lavalin keeps changing, and now sworn testimony is casting serious doubt on whether he‚Äôs being honest with Canadians. He needs to come clean. 
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Burnaby South: Don‚Äôt forget to get out to the polls to vote for @JayShin2019 on Monday! Send Justin Trudeau a message and elect a strong voice for your community. 
Canadians are paying for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes at every turn. Out of control spending, runaway deficits, and new taxes are making life harder. Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are fighting for everyone to get ahead. We‚Äôre #FightingForBetter.

Justin Trudeau is working hard to protect himself in the SNC-Lavalin affair, but Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are fighting for everyone. Trudeau needs to come clean with Canadians. #FightingForEveryone 
Thanks to sworn testimony we know that Justin Trudeau and his office pressured the former Attorney General. He has now also blocked repeated attempts for full investigations. He is obstructing what really happened, he must come clean with Canadians. 
Congratulations @USAmbCanada on your nomination to the United Nations. I‚Äôve enjoyed our conversations and I‚Äôm grateful for having had the opportunity to build the Canada/US relationship with you. 
There was stunning testimony this week at the Justice Committee that shed new light on the SNC-Lavalin Affair. It‚Äôs now confirmed that Trudeau‚Äôs office pressured the former Attorney General stop the company‚Äôs criminal prosecution. Here‚Äôs what we know now. 
This week I was in Montreal to meet with community leaders to talk about how we can address the challenges they face and how we can create opportunities for all Canadians to get ahead. 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs actions on the SNC-Lavalin Affair aren‚Äôt those of an innocent man. After being caught interfering in a criminal prosecution, he changed his story 6 times sworn testimony has contradicted his version events. He‚Äôs trying to get away with it, but I won‚Äôt let him. 
Canadians deserve better than the cover-up Justin Trudeau has on offer over the SNC-Lavalin affair. He needs to come clean. Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are fighting for everyone. We‚Äôre #FightingForBetter! 
We recognize that one of the most critical steps in fighting this form of modern slavery is awareness. A National #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay will help equip Canadians to identify trafficking and end it in their communities. #ItHappensHere #KnowHumanTrafficking 
Another one? News today that Justin Trudeau‚Äôs office may have tried to intervene in a second criminal proceeding. This is a government in chaos. 
Incredible! Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals are going to great lengths to cover-up his interference in a criminal prosecution. Yesterday they even shut down the Finance Committee when questions about the scandal came up. These aren‚Äôt the actions of an innocent man. 
Justin Trudeau is making Canadians pay for his mistakes, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. I am fighting for better. I am fighting for everyone. #FightingForBetter

Innocent people don‚Äôt duck simple questions. Watch as I try to get a straight answer out of Justin Trudeau on his role in getting a special deal for SNC-Lavalin. He is hiding something. I won‚Äôt let him get away with it.

UPDATE: The same Trudeau Liberals that promised Canadians transparency just voted against a public inquiry into Justin Trudeau‚Äôs alleged interference in a criminal prosecution. The Trudeau Liberals are continuing their cover-up. 
VOTING NOW: Will Justin Trudeau come clean with Canadians or will he continue his cover-up? MPs are voting to call a Public Inquiry into Trudeau‚Äôs SNC-Lavalin scandal. WATCH: 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs plan to phase out Canadian energy and jobs is working. While the energy industry booms around the world, Canadians are facing a bleak future with this PM. I am proud of Canadian energy, the people who make it work, and will champion them around the world.

Justin Trudeau's cover-up over the past 10 days shows that he is trying to keep the truth hidden from Canadians. He must stop blocking the Justice Committee, waive attorney-client privilege, and come clean. Speaking LIVE in the House of Commons now: 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs SNC-Lavalin Affair may not just be a scandal ‚Äì it could be a crime. That‚Äôs what former Liberal Attorney General Michael Bryant said this week. Conservatives won‚Äôt stop until we get to the bottom of this! 
This latest resignation shows a gov‚Äôt in chaos as Trudeau desperately tries to cover up this scandal. Canadians are rightly concerned about the allegations of political interference in a criminal prosecution. Trudeau needs to stop hiding behind other people and come clean. 
The #UnitedWeRoll convoy is a testament to the importance of Canada's energy sector and the crisis it's facing. Canadian energy workers deserve a government that supports their industry and champions it worldwide. Conservatives will fix the Liberal mess get people back to work. 
Even senior Liberals want Justin Trudeau to end his cover-up. He should stop trying to hide the truth and listen to them.

Justin Trudeau doesn‚Äôt understand the financial challenges Canadians face. Canada's Conservatives will lower taxes so that we can help families get ahead, instead of just getting by. 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs cover-up is on. Canada‚Äôs Conservatives will continue to explore every legal and law enforcement avenue possible to get the answers Canadians deserve. Here is Vice-Chair for the Justice Committee, @Cooper4SAE‚Äôs statement on Tuesday‚Äôs Justice Committee meeting: 
Canadians in Burnaby South, Outremont and York-Simcoe want opportunities to get ahead - not to keep paying for Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes. Our Conservative team is committed to creating prosperity for all. Get out and vote for our fantastic candidates in the advance polls this weekend! 
It‚Äôs been more than a week since reports surfaced that Justin Trudeau‚Äôs office interfered in the criminal prosecution. Since then, he‚Äôs offered no answers and still refuses waive privilege to let Ms. Wilson-Raybould speak. Canadians deserve answers now! 
You work hard for your money and you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes. In #Sask I met with local business operators, students, and energy works to talk about how Canada‚Äôs Conservatives can create the opportunities they need to get ahead. 
Atlantic Canadians are tired of Justin Trudeau taking them for granted. That‚Äôs the message I heard loud and clear during my Atlantic Forum last week. Conservatives have a plan to give Atlantic Canada a strong voice in Ottawa! 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are fighting to get pipelines built. We know that a strong energy sector means prosperity and opportunity all across the country. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre saying NO to Liberal No More Pipelines Bill C-69. LIVE from Moosomin rally: 
Students are tired of this Liberal government. Justin Trudeau cut their textbook tax credit, public transit tax credit, and is making Canadians pay for his mistakes. That's not right. In October, our positive Conservative plan will work for students, not against them. 
Local businesses are the backbone of our economy and communities across Canada. That‚Äôs why I joined @KellyBlockMP, @KevinWaugh_CPC, @ctochor and @BradRedekopp to talk with local businesses about how a Conservative government will create the opportunities they need to succeed. 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs cover-up of the allegations against him and his office was the main topic of conversation during my interview with @GlobalSaskatoon and @TheWestBlock. You can watch my interview this Sunday! 
Addressed the cover-up and allegations of judicial interference against Justin Trudeau and his office this afternoon during my interview with @CTVSaskatoon and @CTVQP. Stay tuned. Interview airing this Sunday. 
Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes make life harder in Saskatchewan. He has attacked farmers, local business operators, and his carbon tax is going to make life more expensive. I'm fighting to make Canada a place where no dream is out of reach. WATCH LIVE from Saskatoon: 
Canada should be a place where no dream is out of reach, where no ambition is too big for anybody. In my meeting with the Saskatoon Sikh community we talked about how we can create opportunities for Canadians to achieve their dreams both today and in future generations. 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are committed to giving Atlantic Canadians a real voice in Ottawa so they no longer have to pay for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes. This week I met with Atlantic Canadians to talk about how we can give them and all Canadians opportunities they need to prosper. 
Saskatoon bound with great company! Thanks for the lift @tomlukiwski from Regina. I‚Äôll be sharing my plan to build a country where all Canadians have the opportunity to get ahead, not just get by. 
It was great having @AndrewScheer in the @CKOMNews studio today! He talked with @JohnGormleyShow about SNC, the carbon tax, and a whole lot more! 
The terrorist attack on Indian soldiers in Kashmir is unacceptable. Canada‚Äôs Conservatives stand with the people and government of India, and our prayers are with the families and loved ones of those killed and injured in this horrific attack. 
On National Flag Day let‚Äôs remember what Canada‚Äôs maple leaf means to us and honour the great Canadians who‚Äôve shaped our nation: 
The Liberals defeated this motion. What is clear, is that the Liberals have no interest in finding the truth and are only interested in helping the Prime Minister cover this up. (3/3) 
Conservative and NDP MPs worked together to come up with a reasonable witness list with three key individuals Canadians must hear from: Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Prime Minister‚Äôs Principal Secretary Gerald Butts, and his senior Quebec advisor Mathieu Bouchard. (2/3) 
Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals had an opportunity to be open transparent on the SNC affair. Instead, Liberal MPs on the Justice Committee helped Justin Trudeau cover up the truth on what happened between the Prime Minister's Office the former Attorney General, Jody Wilson-Raybould. (1/3) 
While this is satire it captures Justin Trudeau‚Äôs complete hypocrisy and utter disregard for openness and transparency. He is clearly trying to cover something up. 
It‚Äôs clear that Justin Trudeau‚Äôs cover-up is on. Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are now exploring every legal and law enforcement option to get Canadians the answers they‚Äôre demanding. 
Yesterday after Liberals at the Justice committee meeting blocked all attempts at accountability, it‚Äôs clear that Justin Trudeau‚Äôs cover-up is underway. Watch my interview with @CTVAnchor from before the meeting here:https://t.co/XHNXioGI1v 
Liberals at today‚Äôs Justice committee blocked all attempts at accountability. It‚Äôs clear Trudeau‚Äôs coverup is underway. Conservatives will explore legal and law enforcement options to hold him accountable for this to get Canadians the answers they deserve. 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs cover-up is on. The actions of his Liberal MPs at committee today are an admission of guilt. Canada‚Äôs Conservatives will explore EVERY investigative avenue to get answers for Canadians. 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are focused on helping Atlantic Canadians and all Canadians get ahead and not just get by. With Opposition Leader @TimHoustonNS, the @nspc Caucus, and donairs for lunch - I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better day in Halifax! 
Finally met @22_Minutes Marg Delahunty! Toughest CBC interview yet . 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are ready to give Atlantic Canadians a real voice in Ottawa. Ready to build a Canada where Canadians have the opportunities to prosper, and where they no longer need to pay for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes. Watch Live from Windsor, NS: 
The five Liberal members on the Justice Committee must do the right thing today and allow the committee to investigate. If they defeat or water down our motion in any way, it is nothing less than an admission of guilt. Watch the Justice Committee live: 
Canada‚Äôs Conservative want to help Atlantic Canadians and all Canadians get ahead. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in Halifax today meeting with the new Nova Scotia PC Leader and Opposition Leader @TimHoustonNS. Speaking to media: 
If Justin Trudeau is innocent, if he has nothing to hide, he should have no problem waiving privilege having his officials testify at committee. Canadians deserve answers and Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are going to fight to get them the answers they deserve. 
Justin Trudeau and the Liberals have taken Atlantic Canadians for granted and are making them pay for his mistakes. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve hosted the Atlantic Forum so that together we can address the challenges facing Atlantic Canadians in our 2019 platform. (2/2) 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are committed to giving Atlantic Canadians a strong voice in Ottawa and the opportunities they need to get ahead. (1/2) 
Newfoundland and Labrador voted Liberal in 2015 and expected a government that would fight for them. Instead, Justin Trudeau has taken them for granted and is making them pay for his mistakes. I met with NL PC Leader @ChesCrosbie to talk about how we can address those challenges. 
Nova Scotians put their faith in Justin Trudeau in 2015 he's turned his back on them. I sat down with Nova Scotia‚Äôs new Progressive Conservative Leader @TimHoustonNS to talk about how we can work together to create opportunity prosperity for all who call Nova Scotia home. 
I met with Premier @BlaineHiggs and his PC caucus to talk about our united front in fighting Trudeau's carbon tax how we can work together to bring western Canadian energy to eastern refineries. These are critically important issues for New Brunswick and all of Atlantic Canada. 
Justin Trudeau has the power to do the right thing. He can waive privilege. He can pledge to allow the Justice Committee to call the full witness list in public view. He must come clean with Canadians. 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs ethical lapses and his disastrous handling of this latest scandal have thrown his government into chaos. He promised Canadians open and transparent government and he has betrayed that promise. Canadians deserve better. 
Justin Trudeau is making local business operators pay for his mistakes. He's even called them "tax cheats." But Canada's Conservatives understand that these local operators create the opportunities that all Canadians need to get ahead. Thanks for having me @Fton_Chamber! 
With @Puglaas resignation, and a cabinet shuffle imminent, it‚Äôs imperative Trudeau ensure the preservation of records, Canadians deserve the truth. His ethical lapses and his handling of this latest scandal have thrown his gov‚Äôt into chaos. I sent him this letter this afternoon: 
Call: 416-223-2858 E-mail: Ali.Ehsassi@parl.gc.ca Tell Ali Ehsassi that he has the power to stop Justin Trudeau's cover-up. He sits on the Justice Committee that will decide the fate of key witness testimony tomorrow. Canadians demand answers.

Here‚Äôs what we know so far about Justin Trudeau and the SNC-Lavalin affair. Conservatives will leave no stone unturned in our pursuit of the truth and to get answers for Canadians. If Justin Trudeau is truly innocent, he should stop his cover-up now and come clean. 
I want to build a Canada where businesses have the opportunity to succeed. Thank you Andrew Oland for talking with me about how breaking down barriers to interprovincial trade and #FreeTheBeer would help companies like @MooseheadLager grow and create jobs for Canadians. 
Justin Trudeau has been taking Atlantic Canadians for granted, and they're tired of it. With the allegations of political interference in a criminal prosecution surfacing, I spoke with @HarryForestell at @CBCNB in Fredericton about how we‚Äôre working to get answers for Canadians. 
The Canada I want is a place where no dream is out of reach, no ambition is too big, and where you can get ahead, not just get by. With Justin Trudeau, Canadians are paying for his mistakes, and it must stop. WATCH LIVE from Fredericton: 
@Puglaas @lraitt That's why we welcome the Ethics Commissioner's investigation. It's a necessary step but by no means should it be the only one. There is potentially criminality at play here and Conservatives will leave no stone unturned in our pursuit of the truth. (5/5) 
@Puglaas @lraitt If, however, Mr. Trudeau stonewalls MPs at the Justice Committee, we will use every legal and law enforcement tool at our disposal to get to the bottom of this case. He is trying to get away with not having to answer for his office. I won't let that happen. (4/n) 
@Puglaas Further, Mr. Trudeau must not block our motion at Justice Committee this week to have his officials testify before Canadians as to what took place. Thank you to @lraitt for urging the five Liberals on that committee to do right by Canadians and support the motion. (3/n) 
Mr. Trudeau continues to muzzle the former Attorney General @Puglaas, refusing to let her tell Canadians what happened and instead claiming to speak for her, as he did today. It's time he allow her to speak for herself. Waive privilege, Mr. Trudeau, and let her speak. (2/n) 
As the SNC-Lavalin affair continues to engulf the government, it becomes more and more important for Justin Trudeau to waive solicitor-client privilege so Canadians can get answers. He claims it's complicated. It's not. He can do it today. He should. (1/n) 
These are the Liberal MPs who sit on the Justice Committee. They have the power to make sure the hearings go ahead and key witnesses testify. Give them a call, make sure they know that Canadians are demanding answers. They have the power to stop Justin Trudeau's cover-up. 
Justin Trudeau is on the run, trying to avoid the very things he once promised to champion. But Canada‚Äôs Conservatives will use every possible political, legal, and investigative option to get the answers Canadians demand. WATCH LIVE my media avail: 
ICYMI, read this article: 
If Justin Trudeau is innocent, if he has nothing to hide, he should have no problem waiving privilege and having his officials testify at committee. Otherwise it is clear he is afraid of the truth. 
Targeted tax relief brought in by past Conservative governments mainly helped low- and middle-income Canadians. Trudeau scrapped those tax credits, and now more Canadians are being forced to put their dreams on hold because the Trudeau Liberals are making life more expensive. 
Trudeau the candidate was a relentless cheerleader for openness, accountability, and open government. On this, Trudeau the PM has become a fraud. He is now on the run, trying his best to avoid the very things he once promised to champion. I will not let him get away with this. 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are focused on giving Atlantic Canadians a real voice in Ottawa. This week I‚Äôm meeting with Premiers, community leaders, and our strong Conservative candidates to talk about how we can create opportunities for Atlantic Canadians to get ahead. 
Jill and I are saddened to hear that former Finance Minister and Ambassador Michael Wilson has passed away. We‚Äôre thankful for his service to Canadians and his dedication to mental health advocacy. Our prayers are with his family and loved ones this evening. 
The allegations tabled against Justin Trudeau‚Äôs office this week are incredibly disturbing. After Justin Trudeau‚Äôs refusal to come clean with Canadians, the emergency Justice Committee meeting will be the first step in getting Canadians some answers. 
Justin Trudeau is completely out of touch with the everyday struggles that low-income families face. While he makes life more expensive, Canada's Conservatives will help families get ahead, instead of just getting by. 
Generations of local business owners and the people they employ have benefited from the tourism the White Rock Pier brings. I talked with @CPC_HQ candidate @KerryLynneFindl about the importance of the White Rock Pier to the community, and thanked her for her work on their behalf. 
Canadians deserve answers as the allegations surrounding this 'matter' strike at the very heart of fair and impartial law enforcement and prosecutorial functions. If Trudeau doesn‚Äôt meet this obligation, Canadians can only conclude there is something he wishes to keep hidden. 2/2 
Justin Trudeau must waive privilege in the SNC-Lavalin affair, and this morning I called on him to do so. 1/2 
Conservatives, in cooperation with the NDP have called for an emergency meeting of the Justice Committee as a first step that can be taken quickly to get Canadians some answers on Justin Trudeau‚Äôs latest ethics scandal. 
Canadians are sick of Justin Trudeau treating their money like it was his own personal trust fund. Thank you @RachaelHarderMP for being the voice of hard working Canadians. 
Congratulations Dennis King on being selected as the new leader of the @PEIPCParty. I look forward to working with you to lower taxes and help all Islanders get ahead. #peipoli 
Justin Trudeau actually said this week that low-income Canadians don‚Äôt pay taxes. They do ‚Äì and they‚Äôre the ones who can least afford four more years of him as Prime Minister. 
If Justin Trudeau wanted to come clean with Canadians, he could waive that privilege with the stroke of a pen. His refusal makes it look like he‚Äôs covering something up. 
It's hard to believe Justin Trudeau actually said this, but there it is. He doesn't get it. Low-income Canadians do pay taxes, they do benefit from reductions, and - unlike Justin Trudeau - we understand that they are having a hard time getting ahead. In October, let's fix that. 
Incredibly disturbing reports this week. Conservatives, in cooperation with the NDP, have called for an emergency Justice Committee meeting to hear testimony from key players. 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs refusal to waive his privilege speaks volumes. The emergency Justice Committee meeting we, and the NDP, have forced next week is the first step in trying to get Canadians some answers. 
Canada is now spending more on debt interest payments than on the Canadians Forces. His debt and deficits today are your tax increases tomorrow. Thanks @ronliepert for your work holding Justin Trudeau to account. 
Reports on PMO interference in a criminal prosecution are incredibly disturbing. Justin Trudeau has failed to come clean with Canadians about what he knew about this case and when he knew it. I have now called for an emergency Justice Committee hearing for key players to testify. 
In Question Period today Canada's Conservatives had a simple question for Justin Trudeau's Liberals. Judge for yourself - are they answering the questions from Canadians? It's time for Trudeau to come clean. 
You said it, Justin Trudeau. Canadians deserve answers and nothing short of full disclosure from you will do. Let your ministers and staff testify at committee. Let‚Äôs hear the truth. 
Justin Trudeau doesn‚Äôt understand the financial challenges that Canadians face, especially those with low-incomes. His Liberal government has scrapped tax credits those families used, while raising taxes that make life more expensive. Conservatives will help Canadians get ahead. 
Today, in co-operation with the NDP, Canada‚Äôs Conservatives have called for an emergency meeting of the Justice Committee to question Trudeau‚Äôs PMO and other government officials over their potential interference in an ongoing criminal investigation: 
Conservatives are calling for the House of Commons Justice Committee to investigate reports that Justin Trudeau‚Äôs office interfered in a criminal prosecution. WATCH LIVE: 
This cover says it all. Justin Trudeau has failed to come clean with Canadians following incredibly disturbing reports yesterday that his office allegedly interfered with a criminal prosecution. I'll have more to say about next steps in my press conference at 9am. 
Disturbing reports today of Justin Trudeau's office interfering with a criminal prosecution. In #QP I asked clear questions on behalf of Canadians to get answers. This is starting to look like the beginning of a cover up and I will make every effort to hold him to account. 
Justin Trudeau must immediately come clean about who in his office allegedly pressured the Attorney General to interfere in a criminal prosecution. Nothing short of full disclosure is acceptable. Canadians deserve answers. 
Justin Trudeau is raising taxes because he thinks Canadians don‚Äôt pay enough. Saying on Tuesday ‚Äúlow income families don‚Äôt benefit from tax breaks because they don‚Äôt pay taxes.‚Äù That‚Äôs an insult to hardworking low-income Canadians who pay their taxes and just barely get by! 
Justin Trudeau doesn't have a clue how Canadians pay for his mistakes. Low-income Canadians obviously do pay tax, and benefited from Conservative reductions. Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are fighting against his tax hikes. READ:

WATCH LIVE as I respond to the disturbing allegations published today that the Justin Trudeau‚Äôs office tried to interfere and shut down a criminal prosecution and fired his Attorney General when she refused: 
I will be responding to this disturbing report at 12:15pm ET from the foyer in Ottawa. You'll also be able to watch on my Facebook page: 
This is incredibly disrespectful to everyone struggling to get by under this Liberal government. Our Conservative team knows that low-income Canadians do pay taxes, and we will continue to work to make life more affordable for them, and all hard-working Canadians. 
Israel is a beacon of freedom, and during our talk today, I told Ambassador Barkan that Canada's Conservatives stand by Israel as one of its closest friends and allies. When we form government, we will recognize Israel's decision to call Jerusalem their capital. @IsraelinCanada 
New Brunswick Premier @BlaineHiggs continues to stand up to Justin Trudeau on the carbon tax and I was happy to reiterate to him that @CPC_HQ stands with him! Thanks for the meeting this morning in Ottawa, Premier Higgs. 
.@CPC_HQ understands things are already expensive enough, and Canadians are struggling to make ends meet. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so insulting, condescending, and wrong for Justin Trudeau to say ‚Äúlow-income families don‚Äôt benefit from tax breaks because they don‚Äôt pay taxes.‚Äù 
On behalf of our @CPC_HQ team, we‚Äôre saddened to hear that Paul Dewar has passed after his battle with brain cancer. Our prayers are with his family, loved ones and @NDP family as they grieve this loss and remember his legacy. 
Low-income Canadians *do* pay taxes, despite what Justin Trudeau thinks. Conservatives are holding Trudeau to account today for his out-of-touch comments yesterday. Watch #QP Live: 
I still can‚Äôt believe these words came out of his mouth. How out of touch do you have to be to believe low-income Canadians don‚Äôt pay taxes? 
A man who inherited everything he has took time today to tell low income Canadians they don't benefit from tax breaks. It's out of touch. It's condescending. It's insulting. And it's wrong. If you earn just $11,809 per year, then you pay federal tax: 
Pleased to meet the new Venezuelan Ambassador to Canada Orlando Viera-Blanco today to discuss this important time for his country. 
Why is Justin Trudeau raising taxes? Because he thinks Canadians don‚Äôt pay enough. Today he said, ‚Äúlow income families don‚Äôt benefit from tax breaks because they don‚Äôt pay taxes.‚Äù What an insult to the hardworking low-income Canadians who pay their taxes and just barely get by! 
@CPC_HQ UPDATE: Justin Trudeau and his MP‚Äôs just voted against our motion that would have blocked new Liberal tax hikes. While Liberal MPs open the door to more Trudeau tax hikes, Canada's Conservatives are fighting to make life more affordable for Canadians. 
MP's are voting now on our @CPC_HQ motion to stop Justin Trudeau from raising your taxes. Conservatives know life is already expensive enough without Trudeau raising taxes at every turn. Will Liberal MPs commit to not raising any more taxes? WATCH LIVE: 
Canadians are having to put their dreams on hold because life keeps getting more expensive, and Justin Trudeau is making it worse. That‚Äôs not right. Today MPs are voting on a Conservative motion calling on Justin Trudeau to not raise your taxes. 
Today's deficits are tomorrow's taxes. Justin Trudeau's spending is out of control and he expects your kids and grandkids to pay the bill. @CPC_HQ is again calling for a commitment from the Liberals not to raise any more taxes. Canadians can‚Äôt afford more of Trudeau's tax hikes. 
Canadians are already feeling the consequences of Justin‚Äôs deficits, and it‚Äôll only keep getting worse. This needs to stop now. Today Conservative MPs are forcing a vote calling on Liberals to commit to no further tax hikes. Contact your MP now and tell them to support our motion 
Enough is enough. Life is expensive already. Canadians can‚Äôt afford to pay for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes. TODAY MPs will vote on a @CPC_HQ motion calling on Trudeau to confirm that he won‚Äôt further raise taxes. This is the second opportunity he's had this last two weeks to do so. 
Today‚Äôs deficits are tomorrow‚Äôs taxes, and our children shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer because of Trudeau‚Äôs frivolous spending. Today Conservative MPs are forcing a vote calling on Liberals to commit to no further tax hikes. Contact your MP now and tell them to support our motion. 
Life is expensive enough Trudeau's tax hikes make it worse. Today Conservative MPs are forcing a vote calling on Liberals to commit to no further tax hikes. Contact your MP now and tell them to support our motion. Canadians should not have to pay for Justin Trudeau's mistakes. 
Happy Lunar New Year! To Canadians of Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese and Taiwanese heritage celebrating, I offer my best wishes. I hope the Year of the Pig will be filled with joy, peace and prosperity for all. 
Happy Lunar New Year! Ringing in the year of the pig with the commitment to form a reliable and hardworking government, so that Canadians can be optimistic about their future, prosper, and achieve their dreams. Watch live as we welcome in the New Year: 
Sober second thought happens outside Ottawa too! Retweet to tell the Senate's Energy committee that you want senators to meet face-to-face with Canadians in their regions concerned about #Trudeau's Anti-#Pipeline Bill #C69. #SenCA #ENEV 
An excellent portrait of a dedicated leader. Jim Prentice served Canadians well throughout his distinguished career as an MP, MLA, federal cabinet minister, and the 16th Premier of Alberta. He is missed to this day. 
Creating opportunity and helping Canadians achieve their dreams are why I‚Äôm doing what I‚Äôm doing. Thanks to Fairchild TV for having me on to talk about the year ahead and to discuss Canada‚Äôs future. 
I'm spending the weekend in Yellowknife, NWT listening to the concerns of residents. #cdnpoli #skpoli #OurYellowknife 
Nice to see the Liberals finally responding to @KentThornhillMP motion to provide aid to the people of Venezuela. Still waiting for action on our motion to list Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group. The Iranian regime is one of Maduro‚Äôs staunchest supporters. 
Heartbroken to hear that three workers were killed in the train derailment in British Columbia. Our prayers are with their families, loved ones and the @CanadianPacific rail family at this difficult time. 
This is an all too familiar conversation. To all resource workers and those who depend on them, Canada‚Äôs Conservatives stand with you and your families. We are proud to champion what you do. 
.@HistoricaCanada does tremendous work promoting Canadian history. Out of respect, I‚Äôve ordered @CPC_HQ to repost the video with a disclaimer that indicates our video has no connection to Historica. While our video is a parody, Trudeau‚Äôs ethical breaches are sadly all too real. 
Jill and I were saddened to hear of Auditor General Michael Ferguson‚Äôs passing. On behalf of @CPC_HQ I offer my deepest condolences to prayers for his family, and loved ones. He served Canadians with honour and dedication throughout his remarkable career and he will be missed. 
Yet another example of divisive name calling from the Liberals. What is Trudeau‚Äôs positive campaigning promise worth if he doesn‚Äôt rebuke his MP for this? 
The White Rock Pier and the tourism it brings has been supporting local businesses and the people they employ for generations. Thanks @Kerrylynnefindl for sharing with me the importance of the pier to the community and all the work you‚Äôve done to raise awareness about the issue. 
Life is already expensive enough in BC, and so this week I was on the ground talking with people about how we can start to make life more affordable. Jay Shin and Kerry-Lynne Findlay are strong @CPC_HQ candidates who will fight to help you get ahead, instead of just getting by. 
Canada's Conservatives are focused on helping you get ahead because we know, if Justin Trudeau gets re-elected, he'll raise your taxes to pay for all of his mistakes. If you live in Burnaby South, vote for @jayshin2019 and help to make life more affordable for all Canadians. 
Veteran Brian McKenna stood up to advocate for his wounded brothers and sisters in a moving moment at the @SBofT today. He wants our troops to have the equipment they need and to receive the support they were promised in 2015. I couldn‚Äôt agree more. 
I believe in providing the best possible services for veterans and their families. Those who put their lives on the line for our country deserve nothing less. Thank you to all the veterans who came out to meet me and @CPC_HQ candidate Tamara Jansen today in Surrey. 
Sad news of the fire last night at the Agincourt Rec Centre. That's an important facility for families in Agincourt and the surrounding Scarborough area. Thank you to all the first responders who battled the blaze in freezing temperatures. Hope the facility can be repaired soon. 
Saddened to hear of Ron Joyce‚Äôs passing. Mr. Joyce was an iconic Canadian entrepreneur whose life‚Äôs work left a lasting cultural legacy in cities and towns across the country. Thanks for your contributions to Canada, Mr. Joyce. Our prayers are with your loved ones today. 
While Justin Trudeau keeps making you pay for his mistakes, we‚Äôre fighting to help YOU get ahead. Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are entering 2019 firing on all cylinders, and we kicked off the year in Parliament earlier this week. 
During #BlackHistoryMonth we reflect on the history of Canada‚Äôs vibrant Black, African and Caribbean communities. Let‚Äôs take the time this month to learn more about the stories, experiences, hardships and triumphs of Black Canadians: 
Canadian business owners the people they employ have had their dreams dashed under Trudeau‚Äôs government. I'm going to stop that. I will give every Canadian the opportunity to achieve their dreams, no matter how big or small. Watch live from the @SBofT: 
Great initiative for families in Saskatchewan! Alliance Energy is donating $5 for every share of the @PattisonKids radiothon and use of this hashtag: #AllianceEnergy4Kids 
Canada‚Äôs Conservatives are working to help you get ahead. Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Carbon tax costs YOU but gives the biggest emitters a break. And he‚Äôs planning to give you an even bigger bill after the next election. 
On behalf of @CPC_HQ I offer my deepest condolences to prayers for the @AirTindi community loved ones of the 2 pilots who lost their lives. I thank the crew of the RCAF‚Äôs 435 Squadron, Air Tindi Pilots, the Canadian Rangers, the RCMP for their efforts in the rescue mission. 
I‚Äôm fighting to end Justin Trudeau‚Äôs attack on local business, make life easier for local business owners and the people they employ. Hard-working Canadians shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for Trudeau‚Äôs mistakes. I was happy to share this commitment today with members of the @BurnabyBOT. 
I want to make sure Canadians have the opportunities they need to achieve their dreams. I‚Äôm excited to be in Burnaby tonight with our @CPC_HQ candidate @JayShin2019, and a crowd that‚Äôs ready for a government that fights for them. Watch LIVE: 
Spoke to the media this morning about how Justin Trudeau is continuing to make Canadians pay for his mistakes. Today we learn that Trudeau overpaid for a pipeline that he can‚Äôt get built. #fail 
Canada's Conservatives are proud to stand with all the workers and families who depend on jobs in oil and gas. Thanks @suitsandbootscanada! #KillBillC69 
Justin Trudeau's plan: replace our 40-year-old CF-18s with 40-year-old F-18s from Australia, *while paying more* to develop F-35s that he doesn‚Äôt want to buy. What a debacle. And it's our men and women in uniform who are being forced to pay for Justin Trudeau's mistakes. 
.@CPC_HQ believes every Canadian deserves representation by someone who understands their needs. As Prime Minister I will scrap Trudeau‚Äôs Ottawa-knows-best approach to the North and make sure you have a voice at the table. Thank you @jonasjsmith for this important piece: 
The bill for Justin Trudeau‚Äôs border mess just keeps going up. And it‚Äôs not just in Toronto. Canadians everywhere are paying for this mistake, to the tune of $1.6 billion. And counting. 
Suppressing a free press goes hand-in-hand with oppressing free people in any socialist 'paradise'. @CPC_HQ continues to stand with the people of Venezuela who are fighting for their rights, their freedom, and their country against a disastrous socialist dictatorship. 
Justin Trudeau's mistakes are costing Canadians real money. This has to stop. 
Justin Trudeau's Liberals have done more name-calling and fear-mongering than anyone. Trudeau should stop accusing others of it until he looks in the mirror. 
Looks like Justin Trudeau is about to launch another Liberal attack on law-abiding firearms owners. My plan for #ASaferCanada respects Canadians who obey the law while getting guns out of the hands of criminals. 
That's another $2.5 billion of YOUR money gone, left to future generations to pay back. Canadians are being left to pay for Justin Trudeau's mistakes, and taxes are going up because of it. 
Amidst rising interest rates and shifting trade alliances, Trudeau has added record deficits, more debt, and higher taxes. This is a recipe for disaster. Canadians just can‚Äôt afford four more years of Justin Trudeau. (2/2) 
Troubling news about the Canadian economy. Downturns are inevitable, so it‚Äôs important that we‚Äôre ready to withstand them. But Justin Trudeau has spent the cupboards bare in good times and has left us vulnerable to the next downturn. (1/2) 
This doesn‚Äôt go far enough. Liberals have left the door wide open to their friendly foreign-funded special interests who want to influence how Canadians vote and tilt the election in their favour. We must stay vigilant to protect our elections. 
Life is already expensive enough for Canadians, but instead of helping, Justin Trudeau is making it worse. Make no mistake: if Justin Trudeau wins in October, his Carbon Tax will only go up. Canada's Conservatives are fighting to make life more affordable, so you can get ahead. 
During today‚Äôs #QP I‚Äôm asking Justin Trudeau why Canadians are paying for his mistakes on China? And how much will Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Carbon Tax cost Canadian families and how much will he increase it by? Watch live: 
Today marks the 9th annual Bell Let‚Äôs Talk Day. Bell will donate $0.05 to Canadian mental health initiatives for every text message sent on Bell‚Äôs mobile network, and for every tweet and retweet using hashtag #BellLetsTalk! Let's try to make 2019 a record year! 
Join the conversation #BellLetsTalk. #EML 
This Liberal MP let slip Justin Trudeau‚Äôs post-election plan for the carbon tax: it will go up. 
Today is #BellLetsTalk Day. Join the conversation and help end the stigma around mental illness now! #MentalHealthAwareness 
Be kind to your mind. Let's talk about mental health. #BellLetsTalk 
It‚Äôs #BeIlLetsTalk day 2019! A great initiative supporting #mentalhealth programs in Canada. No one should suffer in silence. #BellLetsTalk 
Today is #BellLetsTalk when we start conversations on mental health to help people start their journey to getting well. Let's also recognize how much talk can help. 
My husband #DaveBatters died by suicide. Let's use #BellLetsTalk Day to shine light where there is darkness for too many. 
Justin Trudeau should have shown leadership and fired his ambassador to China right away. Instead he spent days defending him, doing further damage to Canada's reputation around the world. It never should have come to this. 
We‚Äôre all having important conversations about mental health today. Mary Deacon, Chair of @Bell_LetsTalk, and I talked about the strides being made in reducing the stigma around mental health and providing support for Canadians. #MentalHealth #BellLetsTalk 
Many Canadians are touched by #MentalHealth challenges, and too often suffer in silence. On #BellLetsTalk day, let‚Äôs be open about it. Reach out to a family member, loved one or medical professional and know that there's support out there for you. @Bell_LetsTalk @MPMarilynGladu 
Lives are at stake, Canada's reputation is being damaged, and Justin Trudeau's weakness and indecision are making it worse. So when I asked him about the situation with China, the answer he gave was, shall we say, unhelpful. Canadians are paying for his mistakes. 
Justin Trudeau‚Äôs plan to phase out Canada‚Äôs energy sector is working, and once again it‚Äôs Canadians who are paying for his mistakes. Instead of developing responsible Canadian energy, more oil will come from places like Iraq. This is worse for workers and the environment. 
Conservatives believe in the power of Canadian business to help people get ahead. That‚Äôs why I was happy to talk with Canadian business leaders at the @BizCouncilofCan today about how my vision for Canada will create opportunity for Canadians. 
Justin Trudeau's promise to balance the budget this year is in tatters and his deficits are out of control. His deficits today will become Canadians‚Äô taxes tomorrow: 
@CPC_HQ UPDATE: Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals just voted to continue using YOUR hard earned money to pay for their mistakes. They also wouldn't commit to stop raising your taxes in the future. Conservatives will always fight for Canadians and are committed to helping you get ahead. 
VOTING NOW: MPs are voting on our @CPC_HQ motion that calls on Justin Trudeau to balance the budget and never introduce any new taxes. It's time for Canadians to stop having to pay for Justin Trudeau's mistakes. Watch how your MP votes: 
Justin Trudeau's promise to balance the budget this year is in tatters and his deficits are out of control. His deficits today will become Canadians‚Äô taxes tomorrow: 
.@GuyLauzonMP served his community with so much pride for 15 years, and I‚Äôve been so thankful to have him part of our Conservative family. To Guy, I wish you and Frances nothing but the best as you start on this new journey. 
The cost of Justin Trudeau‚Äôs border mistakes keeps going up and Canadians are paying for them. This is exactly why he will raise taxes if he‚Äôs re-elected. He‚Äôs spending everything he gets his hands on and he‚Äôs going to come back for more! 
@googlecanada It appears @googlecanada has now corrected this obvious error. Glad that Canadians spoke out alongside me and got it fixed. Omar Khadr should never be celebrated as a Canadian hero. 
This reckless move by Trump on the Golan Heights runs contrary to international law only further complicates a very tense situation on the border, while undermining any attempt at peace. I call on the Trudeau government to strongly condemn this decision. 
Once allowed to grow, racism hatred spread like fire. Uprooting systemic racism within society our institutions requires us to challenge the status-quo. My statement on the Intl Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination: #FightRacism 
Sending my very best wishes to everyone celebrating #Nowruz ‚Äì a vibrant powerful celebration of the values of hope, inclusion respect for the environment. Har Ruzetan Nowruz! Nowruzetan Pirouz. 
This is why Canadians deserve an independent public inquiry. PM Trudeau must act with integrity give people the opportunity to know what happened in this escalating breach of public trust. Anything else falls short of leadership. #SNCLavalinScandal 
Parliament just passed @GeorginaNDP's C-369 to make the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation a statutory holiday! An opportunity to reflect on the legacy of residential schools pay tribute to the survivors. Thank you Georgina ‚Äì this is an important day for Reconciliation. 
PM Trudeau once again failed Quebec with the #2019Budget. We know that better is possible: A shift to a green economy, comprehensive pharmacare closing tax loopholes for rich corporations like Netflix ‚Äì today we stood together to fight for the priorities that matter to Quebec. 
Prime Minister Trudeau's story continues to not add up. Canadians deserve answers ‚Äì and as the Liberals continue to shutdown the work of committees to get to the truth, it's clear that an independent public inquiry must take place before the election. #SNCLavalinScandal 
Wishing everyone celebrating Purim a joyous holiday. Chag Purim Sameach! 
Wishing a very happy colourful Holi to all those celebrating in Canada and around the world! 
Where was Prime Minister Trudeau in Oshawa when GM walked out? When Sears was stealing pensions? When Trump imposed tariffs on Cdn steel/aluminum? When his own government undermined striking postal workers? We believe in standing up for workers ‚Äì not using them as an excuse. 
Myüß°for the french language began as a kid when I learned about how important it was for the culture identity of so many communities. New Democrats will always fight to protect improve services for Francophones across Canada. ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/lfHlKxsg9O #Francophonie2019 
On #Budget2019 ‚Äì we know better is possible. Universal pharmacare for all Radical shift towards a green economy Making corporations the rich pay their fair share Half a million units of affordable housing We would make different choices that actually prioritize people! 
"They are just kind of leading Canadians along. They are saying OK wait and see, wait and see. Well, Canadians can't wait and see anymore," says @theJagmeetSingh about the Liberal budget #cdnpoli 
Today I asked PM Trudeau why he won't call a public inquiry into the #SNCLavalinScandal. His response: because "we have confidence in our committees their work" ü§î You mean the committee that just today you had shut down the investigation into the matter? That committee? 
Just walked out of #Budget2019 lock up ‚Äì and it's clear that corporations called in favours from Trudeau's PMO because it paid off with a continuation of corporate handouts, while leaving crumbs for Canadians who clearly weren't the priority here. Very disappointing. #cdnpoli 
The Trudeau Liberal gov't continues to side with rich corporations their wealthy friends over Canadians ‚Äì it doesn't have to be this way. People deserve a government that's on their side. LIVE: Tune into Question Period now watch my questions: 
NDP MP Tracey Ramsey comments after justice cttee meeting on SNC-Lavalin: "The fact that now this study is over with, the Liberals want Canadians to believe that the truth has come out, there's nothing to see. People still have questions and they deserve answers." #cdnpoli 
In the last three federal budgets we‚Äôve seen the Trudeau government side with rich corporations their wealthy friends over over. In #Budget2019, PM Trudeau can make different choices for different results prioritize the needs of Canadians. Here's what we're looking for: 
This is a new low from the Trudeau Liberals - they‚Äôve just decided that Canadians ‚Äúhave the necessary information‚Äù on the #SNCLavalinScandal and intend on shutting down the justice committee‚Äôs investigation. That means no more testimony no more answers that you deserve. 
Today's resignation of Michael Wernick raises even more questions on the #SNCLavalinScandal. What else has to happen for PM Trudeau to launch an independent public inquiry? Regardless of how hard the Trudeau Liberals are trying to make this go away, Canadians deserve answers. 
PM Trudeau thinks he can put the #SNCLavalinScandal to rest by naming a sponsorship scandal era Minister, who's literally scheduled to attend a #LPC fundraiser, as his special advisor on the scandal. We need an independent public inquiry. Full stop. 
Too many Canadians are working hard but struggling to get ahead ‚Äì all while the Trudeau Liberal government tells them to wait for solutions. It doesn't have to be this way. LIVE: Watch my first questions to PM Trudeau in the House of Commons: #cdnpoli 
@courtghoward @CBCTheHouse @JustinTrudeau @ElizabethMay @AndrewScheer This is pretty cool ‚Äì I'll try to get those beans in my jar as often as possible 
Sworn in officially in this. Now we double down on fighting for the help that Canadians need ‚Äì from ensuring everyone has a place to call home to making sure healthcare covers us the way it should ‚Äì I'm determined ready to make life easier for people. Let's get it. #cdnpoli 
Excited ready to be officially sworn in as an MP today and have my first day in the House on Monday! Retweet if you agree we can build a Canada where every kid can dream big, break barriers fight to improve the world around them #cdnpoli 
Wishing a very happy #StPatricksDay to all those celebrating in Canada around the world! 
Islamophobia white supremacy unopposed, spreads it kills. When political leaders refuse to name disavow this, or give space to those who preach it, they normalize it. Leaders use their platform to call out oppose hatred - they don't use it to empower white supremacists. 
Heartbroken by the devastating news of deadly shootings at two mosques in New Zealand. My heart goes out to the families of the murdered and all those impacted by this act of terror. Islamophobia kills - and has no place anywhere in the world. 
Decades of Liberal/Conservative govts have rigged the economy. Billionaire insiders have grown their wealth by $20 billion w/ stock options, loopholes offshore tax havens. What do most Canadians get? An unprecedented housing crisis record family debt. 
Moments before the Trudeau Liberals used their majority to stonewall debate block Ms. Wilson-Raybould from speaking her truth, NDP MP @Traceyram laid out the facts made it clear why Canadians deserve answers. A public inquiry is needed now more than ever. #SNCLavalinScandal 
The Trudeau Liberal majority committee voted to block debate today prevent Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould from returning to speak her truth on the #SNCLavalinScandal. If it wasn't already clear that we need an independent public inquiry ‚Äì it is now #cdnpoli 
Decisions made in Ottawa have rigged a system that allows for billionaires to increase their wealth by $20 billion, at the same time that 1.2 million kids live in poverty 46% of Canadians are just $200 away from financial insolvency. We'd make different choices: #Budget2019 
The work of community members, families and groups like Bear Clan Patrol @bearclanmb are caring for and protecting precious children and youth, and we must support them. 
Canada failed Tina Fontaine. And there is no more appropriate measure to judge a society than by how it treats its children. We must heed the calls of Indigenous communities act now to prevent further tragedies ‚Äì words alone are not enough. 
The last 3 federal budgets have failed ‚Äì and by refusing to fix the mess that the #CPC created, we‚Äôve seen the Liberals make wrong choices over over. @MPJulian and I wrote to PM Trudeau asking him to use #Budget2019 to prioritize the needs of Canadians: 
From #SNCLavalin to Sears, big banks big pharma, the wealthiest and rich corporations get a break ‚Äì and you‚Äôve been paying for it. It doesn't have to be like this. We can make different choices for different results. Here's what we want to see in PM Trudeau's #Budget2019: 
Very important to note that this is the anti-bribery wing of the OECD. We've now got Intl organizations concerned about the priorities of the Trudeau Liberal gov't who continue to chose the side of corporate insiders over the rest of us. #SNCLavalinScandal 
New Democrats across Canada connected with people across the country this weekend to fight for action on the #HousingCrisis ‚Äì and got a great response. Check out what people are saying ‚Äì and what you can do to help 
Staff Sgt. Babineau‚Äôs experience inside the RCMP can‚Äôt be ignored. It illustrates anti-black racism‚Äôs corrosive influence on the culture of policing in Canada. And demands prioritizing criminal justice reform to prevent the further erosion of public trust. 
I understand the disappointment that people in Quebec have in Trudeau's Liberal government ‚Äì more than ever, Quebec deserves a progressive alternative that is really on their side. And over the next several weeks, that's exactly what we're going to offer. #cdnpoli 
New Democrats will also have @bsansoucynpd leading the work on a bold, visionary platform for Quebec that deals with climate change, workers culture in meaningful ways. Together, we'll recruit a team of candidates that's ready to fight for the help people are waiting for. 
The NDP is determined to redouble our efforts to make Jack Layton's dream of uniting the progressives of Quebec the rest of Canada a reality. So today, I announced @AlexBoulerice as @NDP Deputy Leader our intention to be the bold, visionary ally that the ppl of Quebec need. 
Deeply saddened by the tragic news of the 157 lives lost in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. My thoughts are with the families and loved ones who are going through so much pain right now. 
My column for International Women's Day 
This International Women‚Äôs Day, I salute the courage of women like Loujain al-Hathloul who were imprisoned and even tortured for fighting for equal rights and opportunities for women. That is why I nominated her for the Nobel Peace prize. 
Happy International Women's Day! Here's to strong women - may we know them, may we be them, may we raise them! #IWD2019 #NDP 
Happy #IWD2019. A shoutout to all the rad inspiring women pushing the envelope. I wanna see more of you get involved. Run for office. Organize. Support each other. If you need resources on how to do that, check out my campaign school from this summer: 
Each every one of us has a substantial role to play in pushing for real, lasting change towards true gender equality. That‚Äôs #BalanceforBetter ‚Äì and it‚Äôs what we must continue to fight for, each and every day. #WomensDay 
Access to safe, quality affordable housing. Medication coverage for all. A bold new approach to actually fighting climate change. Just some of what we talked about at our Toronto Town Hall ‚Äì and I'm excited ready to keep fighting for the help people are waiting for across 
"We need to make it easier for people to join a union. Many studies have shown how unions play a major role in reducing income inequality," says @theJagmeetSingh to a packed room at the #Toronto townhall. 
#USW National Director Ken Neumann congratulates @NDP Leader @theJagmeetSingh on his recent win in #BurnabySouth. Steelworkers, Jagmeet will be joining us at our upcoming National Policy Conference in Vancouver. Register today: #canlab #USWMetallos19 
What we saw this morning from PM Trudeau wasn‚Äôt accountability or an apology - it was the PM blaming everyone but himself. It was the PM discrediting the detailed testimony of Canada‚Äôs first Indigenous woman AG. The ‚Äúerosion of trust‚Äù is with Cdns - we need a public inquiry. 
Question for PM Trudeau and the Liberal majority Justice Committee: Why are both Gerald Butts Michael Wernick allowed to speak about the Jan 14th post-shuffle period, but Ms. Wilson-Raybould isn't? Invite her back, and let her speak. #SNCLavalinScandal 
NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says "when they're not wiling to have the key witness who has just been contradicted with really weak testimony by Mr. Butts, when this committee has voted against allowing her to come back...shows very clearly that this is a biased process." #cdnpoli 
PM Trudeau and Gerald Butts promised Canadians they would be different than the cynicism of Harper, or the corporate cronyism of Martin and Chretien. But what Canadians got is the worst of both. #SNCLavalinScandal 
Disappointing to see the Liberals miss the chance to commit to real public #pharmacare today. I get it ‚Äì taking on big pharmaceutical companies takes courage. We won't back down. The NDP will continue fighting for truly public, universal comprehensive #pharmacare for all. 
Of course PM Trudeau thinks a political apology will make it go away ‚Äì that's what entitlement looks like. We're talking about severe allegations of interference by the PMO/Trudeau himself that put corporate insiders above Cdns. What we need is a public inquiry to get answers. 
Instead of actually fighting #ClimateChange investing in the green economy of tomorrow, you: Spent $4.5 billion on a pipeline Increased the risk of oil tanker spills in our waterways Spent $1.6B/year in fossil fuel subsidies Failed to hit Harper‚Äôs weak emission targets 
Decades of Liberal Conservative power-share have rigged a corrupt system that puts the ultra-rich over all Cdns. So on #SNCLavalinScandal let's be clear about two things: Trudeau must be held accountable via public inquiry, and Scheer's Conservatives have no standing here. 
Jane Philpott‚Äôs resignation underscores the need for a public inquiry now more than ever. It raises serious questions about PM Trudeau's interference the LPC government's commitment to reconciliation with Indigenous people. Canadians deserve a government on their side #LavScam 
The testimony last week from Jody Wilson-Raybould suggested that Trudeau has seriously eroded a pillar of Canadian democracy. Canadians deserve answers from this Prime Minister and a public inquiry is the best place to get to the full truth. 
"It‚Äôs not too late for the Trudeau government to rethink this issue and choose expungement over pardons. It should do so." 
So in order to show he‚Äôs not beholden to corporate interests, he‚Äôs going to switch to a file where *checks notes* He gifted an extra billion dollars to American oil barons to buy a 65 year old leaky pipeline. Makes sense. #ClimateLeadersDontBuyPipelines 
Not a day goes by where I don't hear from people struggling to pay for medication, rent or student debt ‚Äì all while Trudeau's Liberal government jumps through hoops for their wealthy friends. If we want different results, we need to make a different choice. #SNCLavalinScandal 
On behalf of all New Democrats, I want to thank @NathanCullen for his tireless leadership ‚Äì from protecting our coast to fighting to make every vote count, your work-ethic in out of the House has improved the lives of Canadians and we wish you all the best in your new chapter. 
#CannabisAmnesty created this really great graphic that explains why record suspensions don't give Canadians the protection and freedom they deserve. Record suspensions do not go far enough! Please share and spread the word! 
Given the credibility severity of allegations against the PM of putting the interests of corporate elites over all people, with the Leader of the Opposition, I'm calling for PM Trudeau to recall the House so we can continue pursuing the truth for Canadians. #SNCLavalinScandal 
On Trudeau's interference scandal: We knew the halls of power were rigged for the ultra-rich ‚Äì it has been for decades in the PMO. What Ms. Wilson-Raybould revealed in detail is just how far that rigging has gone to put the needs of the corporate elite over everyday Canadians. 
Thank you @MurrayRankin for fighting to make life fairer for more people ‚Äì from advocating for a more just tax system to ensuring Canadians serving on jury duty get the support they need more ‚Äì your leadership made a difference in the lives of people we wish you all the best. 
Now more than ever we must pursue the full truth with a public inquiry into Trudeau's interference scandal ‚Äì we've only scratched the surface. Only then will we ensure full accountability for this alarming breach of public trust. Canadians deserve no less. 
Thank you @GuyCaronNPD for your dedication and steady hand serving as our Parliamentary Leader in the House. I'm excited ready to now join you and our colleagues in Parliament to continue fighting to make life easier for more Canadians. 
It was awesome meeting you Maddie. You have such a positive energy. Wishing you continued success! 
Yes my friend, it definitely is 
After the alarming testimony from former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, it's absolutely clear now that we need a public inquiry into PM Trudeau's #SNCLavalin scandal. Add your name now demand answers from this Liberal government: #cdnpoli 
Truly shocking testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould on #SNCLavalin just now ‚Äì allegations of clear political interference veiled threats by the PMO. This is an indication of whose side Trudeau is on ‚Äì not everyday Canadians who need help, but rich corporations who need favours. 
New Democrats are determined to make things easier for people to get ahead, instead of easier for rich corporations to take advantage of you. Today, with a special visit from Ed Broadbent, we regrouped in Ottawa to double down on that fight ‚Äì because you deserve better. #cdnpoli 
A headline brought to you by decades of Liberal Conservative governments in Ottawa: The price of Canada‚Äôs top-selling patented drugs has increased by 800% over 10 years. This is wrong we're tired of it. We won't stop fighting for #pharmacare for all. 
Too many Canadians are working hard but not getting ahead, as governments in Ottawa continue to make decisions that hold down wages, drive up costs cut services we rely on. From more affordable housing to pharmacare for all better wages, we can do more for everyone. #cdnpoli 
Thank you #BurnabySouth! I'm determined ready to fight for the help people need ‚Äì from the housing crisis to health care not covering everyone the way it should, Canadians deserve better. This isn‚Äôt the end of a campaign ‚Äì it's the beginning of one. See you in Parliament. 
Congratulations @JessaMcLeanNDP on your inspiring campaign in #YorkSimcoe. Jessa didn't cut corners ‚Äì she worked hard every single day, built a team from the ground up fought for the help her community needs ‚Äì embodying true grassroots politics. Thanks Jessa for all your work. 
I want to congratulate @JdelCSanchez her team on an incredible campaign in Outremont. Julia put people first in her fight for a cleaner, healthier fairer world for our families today and tomorrow. Thanks for your leadership Julia for all your work in this by-election. 
Before the #BurnabySouth results come out, I want to take a moment to thank our dedicated all-around incredible volunteers ‚Äì your determination to make a difference in your community has powered us the opportunity to fight alongside you has meant the world to me ‚ù§Ô∏è&amp; 
There's only 2 hours left to vote in #BurnabySouth! Together, we can make sure the people of Burnaby have a strong voice in Ottawa. Polls close at 7pm PST ‚Äì find out where you vote here let's finish strong:

Tomorrow is the big day in #BurnabySouth! I'm determined to be a strong voice for people in Burnaby together we can make sure that happens. Polls open 7am-7pm PST ‚Äì and you can make your plan to vote now so you're ready to get to the polls tomorrow: 
Thanks John - and thank you for all that you and your team are doing to make a better B.C for people. 
Imagine if the Trudeau Liberal government spent the billions of public dollars time they put towards buying, defending approving the #TransMountain pipeline, into investing in the low carbon economy we legitimately need now? Maybe we'd actually be climate leaders. #cdnpoli 
The NEB's recommendation to approve PM Trudeau's #TransMountain pipeline while also confirming its significant negative impact on Indigenous rights, greenhouse gas emissions Southern Resident Killer Whales is deeply disappointing. This is not how we combat #climatechange. 
CUPE BC is with @theJagmeetSingh too! 
After months of ‚Å¶@NDP‚Å© pressure the Libs are finally indicating they won‚Äôt ratify the new #NAFTA without Steel Aluminum tariffs removed. This is the right move and I hope they solidify this position now for workers and business who are suffering. 
Today I wrote to the RCMP requesting an investigation into allegations of forced sterilization in Canada. There is no question that forced or coerced sterilizations comprise clear crimes, including assault and torture. Survivors deserve justice. 
Martial arts were a big part of my life ‚Äì they taught me about discipline honour. Throughout his career @GeorgesStPierre epitomized this warrior spirit. The respect he showed in out of the ring were just as legendary as his accomplishments. Congrats on an incredible career! 
Every day, I meet people who work hard but just can't get ahead. These pressures didn't happen by accident ‚Äì for decades, decisions made in Ottawa have put the ultra-rich above everyday Cdns. If we want different results we need to make a different choice. 
Thank you @AnneMTQuach for your dedication to improving the lives of people in Salaberry‚ÄìSuro√Æt. From the dismantling of the Kathryn Spirit‚Äôs wreck to being a strong voice in the fight against climate change, thank you for your leadership. Wishing you your family all the best! 
On behalf of all New Democrats, I want to thank @MarjBoutinSweet for her incredible dedication to the people of Hochelaga. Marjolaine has always put people first with an unyielding commitment to fight for a better society. We wish her all the best in this new chapter of her life. 
"Privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive and I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth." Mr. Trudeau has the power to waive both. People need to know why this Liberal government is helping their friends instead of your families. 
Faced with a #HousingCrisis, Canadians expect their gov't to take action. Along with our previous call for the creation of 500k units of affordable housing, we're proposing a step forward that'll help ensure buying a home isn't just a luxury for the few: 
BREAKING: The Trudeau Liberal government has just voted against the NDP‚Äôs call for a public inquiry into the #SNCLavalin scandal. This isn't the transparency Canadians deserve - add your name to our call for a public inquiry now: #cdnpoli 
Yesterday I introduced a motion on behalf of the @NDP to have a public inquiry on whether former AG Wilson-Raybould was pressured by the PMO in the bribery and fraud trial of SNC-Lavalin. We'll be voting this afternoon! 
This is incredibly devastating. My heart goes out to the parents who are dealing with an unimaginable tragedy, and as the father remains in critical condition. To the family, community and first responders, we will keep you all in our thoughts today. 
Canadians are waiting for action on housing, medication coverage for all more. Yet in Mr. Trudeau's PMO corporate insiders win while you're put on hold ‚Äì this is a problem. Add your name call for a public inquiry into Trudeau's #SNCLavalin scandal ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
Today the NDP is introducing a motion in Parliament calling for a public inquiry in to PM Trudeau's #SNCLavalin scandal, and for the PM to waive solicitor-client privilege for the former Attorney General ‚Äì because Canadians deserve answers. #cdnpoli 
Thanks to @NDP @BrianMasseMP @traceyram @CHardcastleNDP for urging federal government to join Unifor's #BoycottMexicoGM to #SaveOshawaGM today and not buy @GM product from Mexico #canlab 
Canadians expect their gov't to work for them, but when corporate insiders call in favours from Ottawa, the PMO answers ‚Äì this is a problem. So we're calling for a public inquiry into Trudeau's #SNCLavalin scandal to provide Cdns with answers they deserve: 
Out loud and proud #union activist supporting @theJagmeetSingh thanks to all the union members who have helped out on this election. @bcfed #Solidarity @CUPEBC 
Yuniss, Lynda I spent the afternoon knocking on doors talking to people in Burnaby-South. Lots of support for ‚Å¶@theJagmeetSingh‚Å© #NDP candidate Leader. One week to go! Vote Monday Feb 18th in the Advance or Feb 25th! Vote #NDP #forthepeople 
Had an amazing afternoon connecting with friends, volunteers and enthusiastic voters for @theJagmeetSingh! 
The Trudeau government refuses to take simple actions that would mean big savings for Canadians. Again again they've sided with massive companies like big pharmaceutical giants, instead of fighting for affordable medication for all Canadians. #cdnpoli 
It's day 2 of advance polls in #BurnabySouth! Our team is working hard to ensure the people of Burnaby have a voice in Ottawa that will fight for the solutions they need now. Find out where to vote here: 
Thank you to my friends for volunteering today in #BurnabySouth to help get @theJagmeetSingh elected as MP. #Burnaby 
From the skyrocketing cost of housing, to healthcare that isn't covering everyone the way it should ‚Äì the people of #BurnabySouth deserve a voice in Ottawa that will fight for the solutions they need now. Gurkiran I voted early today we're excited to keep this campaign going! 
When rich corporate insiders come calling for favours in Ottawa, who answers the phone? 4 yrs ago it was the Conservative Party keeping the door open, today it's Trudeau's Liberal govt calling the shots. If we want different results, we need to make a different choice #SNCLavalin 
There's a Punjabi saying that one plus one isn't two, it's eleven. Rain or shine, Gurkiran, my forever #valentine is a testament to this saying. Love is powerful ‚Äì and when it brings us together we can do incredible things. 
We're in a loving spirit today - so we wrote you a poem Happy #ValentinesDay from Canada's New Democrats! 
And here's @GeorginaNDP, who along with the valuable help of Julius Park as an interpreter, spoke in Dene in Parliament! Thank you for making sure Indigenous languages have a place in Parliament, and in Canada. #cdnpoli 
This is beautiful so powerful. Language carries with it history, culture, context, identity more. Seeing @RomeoSaganash @GeorginaNDP speak in Eastern Cree Dene in Parliament, along with what it meant to Priscilla, is very special long overdue.

A growing number of Canadians can't afford their medication, all while massive pharmaceutical companies see record breaking profit the Trudeau Govt tells us to wait for solutions. It's time to change this and take these big corporations head on: #cdnpoli 
Canadians expect our government to work in the interest of people, not a multi-national corporation or their ultra-rich friends. If you‚Äôre a business executive you get a direct line to the PMO, but if you‚Äôre a Sears pensioner or a GM auto worker no one takes your call #SNClavalin 
Thank you Gerry Rogers for your service to the people of St. John‚Äôs Centre and all of Newfoundland and Labrador. Your Initiatives in mental health and addictions, women‚Äôs rights and LGBTQ rights helped improve the lives of everyday citizens in the province. 
Jody Wilson-Raybould, the first Indigenous woman AG of Canada, fulfilled her duties with courage conviction. She spoke truth to power in return she was fired by PM Trudeau. Now more than ever, the Liberals must support the Justice Committee‚Äôs investigation into #SNCLavalin. 
Plastic pollution is a direct threat to the health of our communities ‚Äì and half measures broken promises won't cut it. We need to put people the environment first ‚Äì it's time to ban single-use #plastics. Add your name be a part of the solution: 
As we mark the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers, we must commit to doing all we can to prevent the unconscionable practice of using children as weapons of war. #RedHandDay #ChildrenNotSoldiers 
BREAKING: The federal NDP says Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion has agreed to an NDP request that he investigate the role of Justin Trudeau's office in the SNC-Lavalin case. Leader Jagmeet Singh will scrum at 3:30 pm ET/6:30 pm PT from Burnaby, BC. #cdnpoli 
Today, the Ethics Commissioner has agreed to the request by New Democrats to investigate PM Trudeau‚Äôs #SNCLavalin scandal. Canadians deserve answers to what exactly happened in this apparent breach of trust by the Prime Minister's Office: 
Agreed ‚Äì Canadians deserve answers when there's reason to believe the Prime Minister's Office has violated our trust ‚Äì no matter who's in power. #SNCLavalin 
Canadians deserve to know if the Trudeau government sided with a multinational corporation with deep ties to the Liberal Party to get a reduced sentence for their friends ‚Äì PM Trudeau should waive his government‚Äôs solicitor-client privilege on SNC-Lavalin. 
New Democrats have always been on the side of everyday people. Making sure a hospital stay or serious illness didn‚Äôt bankrupt you was step 1. Now it‚Äôs time to take on pharmaceutical insurance companies and provide #pharmacare for all. Give me a call @DanRiffle 
It‚Äôs crystal clear the federal response to the opioid crisis has been ineffective. Deaths have risen every year since 2015. We need a declaration of national public health emergency, safe and regulated supply, treatment on demand, federal support of overdose prevention sites. 
When I meet kids with type 1 diabetes who are worried about the impact paying for their medication has on their parents, I know we need to do better patchwork solutions won't cut it. We're fighting for #pharmacare for all ‚Äì let's get everyone covered: 
Language carries with it meaning, history, context, identity and so much more that is passed from one generation to the next. As we welcome #IYIL2019, let's always strive to do better and fully protect the language rights of Indigenous peoples: 
Canadians need to be able to trust that their government won't just throw out the rules for their ultra-rich friends or fire an AG that stands in their way. PM Trudeau should welcome the opportunity to provide Cdns with an answer to exactly what happened. 
‚ÄúWhat the Liberals are proposing and Mr. Trudeau is proposing is a patchwork system which will not help out all Canadians. It might help out the Bay Street insurance companies that profit to the tune of billions of dollars.‚Äù @TheJagmeetSingh #cdnpoli 
We knew the Trudeau Liberals were willing to do shady things to help their ultra-rich friends ‚Äì but this is something else. Mr. Trudeau needs to explain who authorized attempts to pressure the former Attorney General to let SNC-Lavalin off the hook. 
Paul Dewar represented the best of us ‚Äì he spent his life working for justice believed in the potential of young people to change the world. Paul made Canada a better country and we are all lesser without him. We hold his family close in our hearts. 
We applaud @theJagmeetSingh for this re-commitment to a public, universal #pharmacare program for Canada. This position on pharmacare is principled and evidence-based and, if implemented, would save lives, save money and improve health care for everyone. #CDNHealth #CDNpoli @NDP 
Access to medicine shouldn't depend on your income ‚Äì yet millions of Cdns can‚Äôt afford their prescriptions or have extremely expensive coverage. Half measures won't cut it. It's time to expand our public healthcare to include #pharmacare ùôõùô§ùôß ùôñùô°ùô°. 
This little child was born into a nation of immense riches. She deserves to grow up with hope, safety and health. Anything less it is not acceptable. It is 2019 Canada. The time has come for this nation to step up 
People need solutions to the #HousingCrisis now, not years from now. But the Trudeau Liberal govt keeps telling us to wait, and today they voted against our plan to kick-start relief. We need bold action now that starts with half a million units of quality, affordable housing. 
Canadians face a #HousingCrisis while PM Trudeau tells us to wait for a solution ‚Äì and even worse ‚Äì votes against our plan to build half a million units of housing kick-start relief. New Democrats are determined to fight for solutions people need now ‚Äì not years from now. 
BREAKING: The Trudeau Liberal government has just voted against the NDP‚Äôs plan for safe, affordable housing. Canadians are facing a #HousingCrisis, and yet the Liberals keep telling us to wait for a solution. RT if you agree Canadians can‚Äôt afford to wait. 
Clearly the economy is not working for an alarming number of people. The playing field isn't just uneven ‚Äì it has been intentionally tipped to favour the ultra-rich for decades ‚Äì and every day Canadians are paying the price. 
Gung Hei Fat Choy! Happy Lunar New Year! Wishing you prosperity and good health in the Year of the Pig! @theJagmeetSingh @MPJulian @DonDavies 
For too long, governments at all levels have ignored the growing #HousingCrisis. Canadians need solutions now ‚Äì @theJagmeetSingh Canada's New Democrats have a bold plan to create half a million units of quality, affordable housing. 
Wishing a very happy #LunarNewYear to everyone celebrating! May the Year of the Pig bring success, health, prosperity and happiness to all ‚Äì Êñ∞Âπ¥Âø´Ê®Ç 
On behalf of New Democrats, I join Canadians in celebrating our development workers who work selflessly every day to create a more peaceful, just, and sustainable world. #IDW2019 
Here is footage of the press conference we held calling for a national suicide prevention strategy. Call your MP and make sure they are going to vote for M-174 for a national suicide prevention action plan. 
I'd love to see GM take as much interest in protecting the thousands of people being laid off in Oshawa, as they are protecting their own image. 
Terrible news. Michael Ferguson was a force to be reckoned with, helping to ensure that government worked in the best interest of Canadians. He will be sorely missed - we‚Äôll be keeping his family in our thoughts today. 
Too many seniors who've worked hard, raised a family paid their fair share now choose b/w rent affording the basics in today's #HousingCrisis. I met w/ Voices of Burnaby Seniors to hear their stories share our plan to provide relief build 500k units of affordable housing: 
Wish I was surprised. But once again the Trudeau Liberals are siding with insurance companies w/ an ‚Äúindustry friendly model of pharmacare‚Äù against real, universal medication coverage for all. We have different priorities will make different choices. 
As we celebrate #BHM, we're reminded that Black Canadians continue to be on the frontlines of bearing the burden of injustice overcoming it ‚Äì making life fairer for all of us. We must do more in the fight against anti-black racism systemic injustice: 
Canadians are dealing with a #HousingCrisis while PM Trudeau keeps telling us to wait for a solution. It's time to get moving. We're calling for the creation of half a million units of quality, affordable housing to kick-start the help that people need ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
Climate change is the single greatest threat we face yet PM Trudeau is choosing rich corporations over investments in the future sustainable jobs. The way we combat #climatechange is not by spending billions on fossil fuel subsidies, it's by investing in a clean economy. 
46% of Canadians are on the brink of insolvency nearly one million have cut back on food/heat to pay for medication. Yet the Trudeau Liberals overpaid when they spent $4.5 billion on a pipeline with public dollars? This is not what being on the side of Canadians looks like. 
Congratulations Sheila Malcolmson! @s_malcolmson As the new NDP MLA for #Nanaimo, I know you'll get results for people on issues like housing protecting our coast ‚Äì and I‚Äôm excited to continue working with you and Premier @jjhorgan. #NanaimoVotes 
@NDP standing up for Autoworkers in Ottawa!! @UniforTheUnion THIS is what Solidarity looks like ‚úä 
First Nations communities deserve better than mouldy, substandard housing and a government that refuses to address the problem. ‚ÄúHousing is a treaty right in Canada,‚Äù says @RomeoSaganash. ‚ÄúCanada is obligated to provide.‚Äù 
I know I've dealt with times in my life where my mental health wasn't being cared for the way it should ‚Äì and I know now it's ok to talk about it. Because it's not a weakness ‚Äì it takes strength to share your story ask for the help you need. #BellLetsTalk #EndTheStigma 
Short answer is no. Canadians face a #HousingCrisis Trudeau's Liberal government just doesn't get what people are going through. New Democrats made a bold proposal to fix things that starts with building half a million units of affordable housing.

People in Burnaby across face a #HousingCrisis ‚Äì paying rent is a nightmare buying a home gets further out of reach. The way you fix this isn't by spending billions on a pipeline promising funds in 2020, you fix it by investing in solutions now: 
Two years after the attack on a mosque in Quebec City we pay tribute to the victims the Canadian Muslim community with a commitment: To remain vigilant push back against the rising tide of hate Islamophobia that leads to devastating acts of violence. 
@NDP announced our major new housing policy. Housing affordability isn't just an urban problem, it affects people in rural communities like ours, in Essex too. This new plan takes a bold and immediate step towards guaranteeing a safe, warm home for everyone in Canada. 
We're 3 weeks into the state of emergency in Cat Lake. Temperatures have dropped to -55 and people are in deplorable conditions. I am appalled that the new Minister Seamus O'Regan has done little other than to offer a meeting with regional bureaucrats. 
New Democrats are back in the House this week determined to fight for the solutions Canadians need. Like affordable housing ‚Äì because people can't wait until 2020 for Trudeau's Liberal gov't to step up. Here's how we'd start fixing the #HousingCrisis: 
Another disgusting example of what women face when they enter politics. I know @JdelCSanchez won‚Äôt let this stop her determination to give the people of Outremont the strong voice they deserve. But really, she shouldn‚Äôt have to put up with it. 
Today, we remember the millions of Jews and countless other victims of the atrocities that took place during the Holocaust ‚Äì and we honour the survivors by making it our duty to extinguish anti-Semitism intolerance wherever it is found. #WeRemember 
Honoured to join @JennyKwanBC's annual Lunar New Year luncheon with members of the Chinese media from across the Lower Mainland. In my experience, strong local media helps hold communities together ‚Äì a way of telling our stories and connecting with our neighbours. 
People in Burnaby deserve better. In 3 yrs PM Trudeau has let medication get more expensive, housing prices skyrocket spent billions on fossil fuel subsidies. Our team is growing every day with a determination to make life more affordable find solutions people need. #cdnpoli 
@theJagmeetSingh I met with @BurnabyBOT yesterday. Their vision includes diversity, collaboration, and doing business in a socially conscious way are the key to their success. @theJagmeetSingh and I look forward to building stronger relationship with @BurnabyBOT in the future. 
Venezuelans are facing a humanitarian crisis and Canada can play a positive role by working with its regional partners to provide support. No country should act unilaterally and we must all support a democratic Venezuela with free and fair elections. 
Trans Mountain (now owned by the Trudeau government) says we should ignore the ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù environmental risks from a seven-fold increase in tanker traffic. How can we trust this review when the government is acting as both the prosecution the judge? 
Workers and communities are left to fight for their own futures- while Fed Prov governments barely have a conversation and give up. Shame on Trudeau Liberal‚Äôs and Ford PC‚Äôs for not fighting- @NDP stands with autoworkers shoulder to shoulder in the fight! #Solidarity #SoSoSo 
In Hamilton the cost of housing has increased by over 88% since 2007. The @NDP plan will provide quality affordable housing for the many rather than the few. 
Great. If the Minister truly wants to make home buying more affordable for millennials then he'll implement our proposal to double the Home Buyer's tax credit in the budget. The Liberals call the situation a crisis, it's time they start acting like it is. 
Canadians are told the economy is working ‚Äì but who is it working for? Under PM Trudeau the gap between the ultra-rich the rest of us has widened even further. Let‚Äôs end corporate giveaways. Let‚Äôs close tax loopholes for the rich. And invest in programs that lift everyone. 
Farrah from Burnaby, a mom of 3 pre-teen boys deals with car payments, insurance, groceries more ‚Äì along with the uncertainty of next month's rent. Yesterday we announced our plan to kick-start the help that so many families like Farrah's need: #cdnpoli 
Too many Canadians struggle to make ends meet ‚Äì spending more more of their income just to meet basic housing needs. The Trudeau Liberal government has neglected the #HousingCrisis for too long. It's time to bring forward solutions people need now. 
You and your friends were awesome. I think you're being a little generous with my knowledge of astronomy, but thank you. It was great meeting you. I know you and your crew will be amazing doctors. Oh and make time for art 
Thanks for the shout out but more importantly thanks for taking the time to chat :) 
It was a pleasure meeting you and your crew! 
Canadians face a #HousingCrisis while the Liberals spend billions in corporate tax giveaways billions more on a pipeline. PM Trudeau calls the situation a crisis ‚Äì it's time he start acting like it is. Today we announce our plan to start fixing it: 
This is very tragic ‚Äì my condolences go out to Gilles Duceppe for this terrible loss. We are thinking of you, and sending our love to H√©l√®ne Rowley Hotte's family friends during this difficult time. 
Finding a good, affordable place to live shouldn‚Äôt be like winning the lottery. Today we lay out our plan for how Trudeau must use the 2019 budget to start fixing the #HousingCrisis. By making the right choices, we will build half a million units of quality, affordable housing. 
Ottawa should be fighting for you. Workers' pensions, affordable housing, medication coverage for all ‚Äì this is what we need to prioritize ‚Äì not blanket tax breaks for the richest corporations in Canada. #OnYourSide #cdnpoli 
If that argument includes buying pipelines, spending $1.6 billion/year on fossil fuel subsidies failing on Harper's weak emission targets ‚Äì then we demand better. Save the talk ‚Äì invest in clean energy ‚Äì increase actually meet emission targets. 
The impact of the #HousingCrisis on young Canadians is devastating. The young people I met with in Burnaby want to dream big! Not be squeezed by skyrocketing rent or forced out of BC entirely. We need to build more co-op housing, address speculation we need to do it now. 
Canadians are increasingly concerned w escalating incidents between China + Canada. That‚Äôs why I worked w @ErinOTooleMP to convene #FAAE today. I urge all MPs to vote in favour of a briefing from the Amb @HonJohnMcCallum #cdnpoli @NDP 
My heart goes out to the family and friends of Kirk Woodman after today's deeply sad news of his death in Burkina Faso. Let us ensure his loved ones are given space to grieve during this difficult time. 
We're facing a #HousingCrisis...but let's wait a few years until we actually try fix it ü§î For too many Canadians, finding a home gets further out of reach while Trudeau's govt tells us to wait for a solution. It's time to fast-track funding make life easier for more people. 
Warmest wishes to Tamils in Canada and around the world celebrating the joyous festival of Thai Pongal!! 
This is horrific. The state-sanctioned targeting killing of members of the LGBT community in Chechnya must be met with unequivocal condemnation and a call for this to end immediately. Those responsible must be held accountable. 
Lots of energy as we officially opened our campaign office!! This election is about standing up for the people of #Burnaby and I‚Äôm determined to fight for the solutions we urgently need now. #cdnpoli 
My heart goes out to the families of the victims in today's devastating bus crash in #Ottawa and my thoughts are with the injured. Thank you to the first responders and medical professionals in this critical time. 
PM @JustinTrudeau, let's not give up on Oshawa workers ‚Äì let‚Äôs fight for them. It's time for you to meet with GM CEO Mary Barra, let her know that her decision is wrong. We can save our industry with a better plan implement a national auto strategy, now. 
I didn't mind, in fact I thought it was cute. Lol, she's proud of you! 
The silence from Trudeau is deafening. There are thousands of jobs on the line and a massive hit to our economy. The workers aren‚Äôt giving up, why is their government? #canlab 
As long as Trudeau's Liberal government continues to subsidize the fossil fuel industry, purchase pipelines, and come up short on weak emission targets set by Harper, Canada will fail to do its part to fight #ClimateChange. 
For too long, Ottawa has put pressure on the family budget. From skyrocketing housing prices to out of pocket healthcare costs ‚Äì people need their voices heard and I'm excited determined to fight for the solutions they urgently need. #BurnabySouth #Outremont #YorkSimcoe 
Very concerned with the ongoing situation at the Wet'suwet'en blockade. @NathanCullen visited the site yesterday in support of peaceful dialogue ‚Äì UNDRIP requires us to do the tough work in difficult situations. Where is the federal gov't on this? Trudeau cannot remain silent. 
After consulting the Wet‚Äôsuwet‚Äôen chiefs I will be traveling to the blockade set up along the Morice River to support the chiefs message of peaceful dialogue respect for the land. I will make af formal statement after I‚Äôve met with all sides. 
Trudeau, let me explain. This doesn't mean another study on drug prices. It means starting right now to expand our healthcare system to cover the cost of medication for all Canadians. No more waiting. So @justintrudeau, what‚Äôs it gonna be? 
We ready #BurnabySouth The housing crisis can't wait. Rising out-of-pocket healthcare costs can't wait. While Trudeau's Liberal government plays politics with by-elections, the people of Burnaby South are done waiting for solutions and to have their voice heard in Ottawa. 
Doris Troy scored a big hit with this in 1963. She left the Bronx for London where she was known as Mama Soul. A very young Elton John played piano for her. 
Parliamentarians must follow clear rules: you can't use a parliamentary office to raise cash. @JustinTrudeau seems to think rules don't apply to him. This disdain for ethics has gotten his government into trouble many times. He needs to do better. 
Too many Canadians are losing loved ones to the terrible #OpioidCrisis. In November, 4 people died every day in British Columbia. Until we change our approach, declare a national emergency, and focus on reducing harm, this tragedy will only get worse. 
"My name will be Jagmeet Singh and it means friend to the world I'm here to say hi and that I care about you My secret is I think deep down we all care about each other and together we're going to build a better world" 
I'm definitely not funny so I don't think I was trying to indicate something was a joke It could be that I had a secret to tell or maybe it was signal of affection or greeting I can't say for certain but here's what I think I was trying to say: 
I started with the dictionary wink /wiNGk/ verb 1. to close and open one eye quickly, typically to indicate that something is a joke or a secret or as a signal of affection or greeting 
Here I am all 9.5 lbs of me (sorry mom) This picture was taken 40 years ago today, a day after I was born on January 2nd, 1979 It is my first ever picture So what was I trying say? thread 
New year, same challenges faced by too many people. In 2019 the #HousingCrisis continues to rage across yet Trudeau keeps telling us to wait for a solution. We need to fast-track funding build more not-for-profit housing so people get relief now: 
Happy new year!!!! Tonight, as we welcome in a new year with friends and family, let‚Äôs look forward to what we can accomplish together in 2019. More than ever, we need to have courage and believe that better is always possible. 
The Trudeau govt‚Äôs Public Safety Report dangerously generalizes Sikh Muslim communities without evidence sets a dangerous precedent when it comes to the civil liberties of all Canadians. Sign the petition demand an explanation for this report now: 
Merry Christmas! On behalf of all New Democrats, I extend my warmest wishes for a joyful celebration with family friends this holiday season. 
Canadians rely on their pensions to retire w/ dignity, but thousands of pensioners lose out when companies like Sears fail the Trudeau gov't fails to act. We believe workers retirees must come before big banks CEOs. We can must #EndPensionTheft: 
The future looks bright with a team this 
The BC NDP gov't did what the Trudeau gov't failed to do: They allowed people to make the decision on electoral reform. They lived up to their promise. #prorep To everyone who poured their hearts into this referendum, thank you for fighting to make politics more about people. 
Doug Ford's cancellation of support for the planned Ryerson U campus in #Brampton will have terrible impacts on the community. We're suppose to invest in our students, not abandon them. We're calling on Trudeau's Liberal govt to provide support ensure the project goes forward. 
Some people say you have to "go it alone" That you just have to take care of yourself things will work out. But whether it's the housing crisis, rising cost of medication or climate change ‚Äì the only way we fix things is when we work together solve them. #TuesdayThoughts 
Wow..what a great view from the 28th fl of the Metro Van Tower III where the Youth Homeless Regional Conversation was. @theJagmeetSingh I are fascinated by how beautiful #burnaby is and yet, homelessness is still a reality. We must act now to find solutions. #endhomelessness 
Canadians need relief on housing now. Meanwhile Trudeau's Liberal government tells us to wait gives billions in blanket tax breaks to the richest corporations in Canada. We need to fast-track funding now, not after the next election. 
Canadians rely on their #pension to retire w/ dignity, but thousands of pensioners lose out when companies like #Sears fail the Trudeau gov't fails to act. The NDP believes workers retirees come before big banks CEOs. We can must #EndPensionTheft: 
Honoured to celebrate Yalda with the Persian community here in Port Coquitlam. This is a beautiful celebration that recognizes the importance of community, family and culture ‚Äì thanks for giving me the opportunity to take part. 
Spent some time meeting with leaders local residents from #Burnaby's thriving Korean community - it was an incredible opportunity to talk about some of the solutions that New Democrats are determined to fight for to build a more prosperous society for all of us. 
Thanks for your love and support @BowinnMa ! 
Had some fun at the @IAFF323 #AngelToyDrive and Burnaby Firefighters Pancake Breakfast ü•û @BurnabyFireDept Toys for kids + pancakes? You can't go wrong. Thanks to all the organizers for pulling off such a great event for an incredible cause. 
Thanks to the community at Masjid al Salaam in #Burnaby for having me drop by during Friday prayers ‚Äì I felt the warmth spirit of generosity from all of you, and I'm excited to come by again soon! 
This is heartbreaking. As the voices of hate continue their fear mongering of migrants ‚Äì telling us to resist caring for families in their darkest hour ‚Äì we must confront this intolerance. These are ppl just trying to create a better life for their kids. 
We must call out terrorism wherever it occurs, including recent attacks from the far right targeting women in Toronto Muslims in QC. The Liberal's public safety report fails to do this ‚Äì but does stoke fear w/o any evidence about the Sikh community, which is dangerous wrong. 
Last scrum in #CentreBlock before it closes for a looong time New Democrats are ending 2018 determined to make sure people get the solutions they need. From immediate action on #housing to fighting for workers protecting our environment, we know better is possible. #cdnpoli 
Trudeau tells the world Canada is doing its share to fight catastrophic climate change ... but is letting off the oil and gas sector for 80% of their emissions. So how exactly is letting some of the biggest polluters off the hook saving the planet? 
Climate change is the single greatest threat we face ‚Äì is failing to do its part Cdns are feeling the effects. Instead of contributing to catastrophic #climatechange, we must invest in clean energy end fossil fuel subsidies to reduce our emissions. 
My mom always taught me that we're all connected ‚Äì that when one of us is suffering, we're all suffering. On #HumanRightsDay let's recommit to building a world where the fundamental rights that protect us from persecution oppression are upheld strengthened around the world. 
Yes!!! I'm so excited to have @MatthewGreenNDP as our 2019 candidate in Hamilton Centre. Matthew's proven leadership in #HamOnt ability to organize inspire people to demand better for their community will help us make a positive difference in the lives of all Canadians.

@theJagmeetSingh Thank you everyone who made today‚Äôs @DavenportNDP nomination so awesome. The works begins now!!@maritstiles @theJagmeetSingh @Steph4schools 
From housing to transit, people in Toronto need champions who actually fight for solutions they need now, yet Trudeau's Govt tells them to wait - Toronto can't afford to wait. So today I was thrilled to stand with the incredible @AndrewCash, our 2019 candidate in #DavenportTO! 
I want to thank @FinDonnelly, who has served the people of Port Moody ‚Äì Coquitlam since 2009, with integrity determination to make positive change for his constituents ‚Äì particularly in protecting our coastal communities. On behalf of all New Democrats, I wish him all the best. 
Teachers are on the front line in the fight against Doug Ford's politics of fear division ‚Äì yet with love courage in the face of adversity they continue to literally build a better future, one kid at a time. Thanks @ElemTeachersTO for your work having me out at #FedDay2018! 
We remember the 14 women murdered the 14 others injured, 29 years ago today. We send unending love to their families and loved ones, and we honour them by working every single day to end violence against women in our communities and around the world. #December6 
Plastic pollution is devastating our oceans marine life ‚Äì so the NDP is stepping up to fight for a solution. Congrats to NDP MP @GordJohns whose plan to keep #plasticpollution out of our water successfully passed in the House! Add your name in support: 
29 years ago today, 14 women were murdered 14 others wounded ‚Äì simply because they were women. Today, and everyday, we honour them by working to build a Canada where women girls are free to study, work be themselves without fear of violence: 
Did you know that half of Canadian women will experience violence in their lifetime? We are calling for a national plan to end violence against women. #16Days #HearMeToo #OrangeTheWorld 
We don't have to just accept that half of all women in Canada will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. But to change things, we need to act. It's time for a national action plan to end violence against women. #TimeForAction #VAW 
From skyrocketing housing prices to out-of-pocket healthcare costs, Canadians face big problems ‚Äì and while Trudeau's government refuses to act, our team is focused on fighting for solutions people need now. Happy to kick off our 2018 NDP Staff Forum today in Ottawa! #OnYourSide 
Thank you, to @theJagmeetSingh for coming to #Oshawa. I saw what it meant to the workers to have you come and listen to them. All levels of Gov't need to understand what a plant closure would do to our #community. We must do what we can to keep good jobs here. #SaveOshawaGM 
To the thousands of people whose livelihood is impacted by the devastating GM news, we're here in #Oshawa today to say we're on your side. We know, just like you do, that #OshawaMadeGM Canadians didn't bail them out so they could pull up stakes leave workers without jobs. 
Everyone deserves to feel like they belong in their own community ‚Äì like they're an equal part in the world around them. On this Int'l Day of Persons w/ Disabilities, let‚Äôs re-commit ourselves to building a that is fully accessible to all. #IDPD2018 
On behalf of all New Democrats, I wish the Jewish community in Canada and around the world a bright peaceful #Hanukkah. Chag Hanukkah Sameach! 
Germany: Cancels all current and future arms sales to Saudi Arabia Canada: Keeps selling arms to a human rights abusing country @JustinTrudeau your words ring hollow End the arms deal, stop selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, that's how you stand up for human rights 
On #WorldAIDSDay, we remember those who we've lost to HIV/AIDS and recommit ourselves to doing everything we can to eliminating it ‚Äì Canada can must restore funding and expand the Federal Initiative on HIV/AIDS. 
Workers in Canada are still being impacted by the devastating US tariffs on Canadian steel aluminum ‚Äì today‚Äôs signing of the #USMCA while these tariffs are still in place is a sellout of Canadian workers by the Trudeau Liberal Government. #NAFTA 
Hate is like a fire ‚Äì if we allow it to grow, it will spread consume everything and touch everyone. We must respond with an unequivocal condemnation of hate in all its forms. Nobody should be made to feel unsafe in their own community. 
Climate change is the single greatest threat we face Canada is failing to do its part. Today I signed the Pact For The Transition added my voice to the pledge signed by more than 240k people for real action on #ClimateChange. Read sign The Pact here: 
I love bingeing #StrangerThings too ‚Äì but let's remember #Netflix receives special treatment to avoid paying Canadian taxes. So if they‚Äôre claiming this will help fund exclusive content, it begs the question ‚Äì how much of that new content will be Canadian? 
Met with PM Trudeau #cdnpoli leaders today to discuss support for Franco-Ontarians the role the federal government can must play in protecting those services. In the wake of Premier Ford's cuts, the NDP will continue to protect francophone services across Canada. #ONfr 
Congratulations @RE_Brosseau!! Well-deserved international recognition for our House Leader, who fights every single day to make a positive difference in the lives of Canadians. Keep it up 
We need to stop throwing billions of dollars at companies that just walk away from Canadian workers ‚Äì any investment in companies like #GM need to come with conditions that guarantee job retention job creation for Canadians. #Cdnpoli #Canlab 
The #GM news in #Oshawa is devastating ‚Äì we can't accept these job losses, we need to act now. We're calling on Trudeau to bring together industry, labour government to find solutions that will save these jobs protect our auto-sector in the future: 
Harry was a champion for people with a passion for equality justice. He always stood up to those at the top his presence in the world will be missed. My condolences go out to his loved ones - @Harryslaststand, may you rest in power. #IStandWithHarry 
Canada's seniors worked hard to build a society of prosperity generosity ‚Äì we owe them a debt of gratitude. Thanks @RABlaney for today's discussion with orgs from across Canada on a National #Seniors Strategy to ensure seniors can live healthy, happy with dignity. #cdnpoli 
Too many Canadians barely get by while Liberal/Conservative governments continue putting rich corporations the wealthiest above the rest of us. We can change that. Thanks @bcfed for the chance to share our vision of a progressive gov‚Äôt that works for everyday people. #bcfed18 
Jagmeet Singh, Leader of @NDP, spoke at #bcfed18 about affordable housing, health care system the need for green jobs publicly-managed infrastructure. He also spoke about the @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party back-to-work legislation forcing CUPW members back to work. 
This is devastating news for the thousands of GM workers in Oshawa. My heart goes out to the families affected as well as the entire community. Clearly not enough has been done to protect these jobs. 
@sarasdlklc I'm down, DM the details maybe my wife and I can attend ! 
It simply isn‚Äôt good enough to call yourself a feminist without taking action. Today every day, we recommit ourselves to ending gender-based violence ‚Äì to standing up to sexism, and to acting on solutions for Canadian women. #IDEVAW 
Tonight, in an attack on all workers, the Liberals moved forward with trampling on the rights of striking postal workers. #canlab After walking out of the house in protest the NDP made it clear ‚Äì we oppose this betrayal of working Canadians. We stand with workers. #negos2018 
NDP Leader @theJagmeetSingh : NDP MPs have walked out to protest the Liberal‚Äôs #SuperAntiDemocraticMotion. Postal workers wanted to negotiate safe work and pay equity, but @JustinTrudeau‚Äôs bill removes any incentive for Canada Post to negotiate fairly. #canlab #negos2018 @cupw 
BREAKING: NDP MPs are walking out of the House of Commons to protest the Liberal's plan to take away the democratic right to strike for Canadian postal workers ‚Äì tune in watch live: #canlab #negos2018 
Guru Nanak Dev Ji believed that we are all one equal ‚Äì he led a social revolution founded on love, equality social justice. Happy #Gurpurab to all celebrating! 
On #Holodomor Memorial Day - we reflect on a truly dark chapter in human history. We pay tribute the victims of this systemic and horrific genocide and strengthen our commitment to ensure these atrocities are never repeated: 
Postal workers ‚Äî many of them women ‚Äî need pay equity, fair overtime safer workplaces. They don‚Äôt need legislation forcing them back to work. Today we're standing with @cupw because everyone deserves a healthy holiday season ‚Äî even those who deliver the presents. #negos2018

Today Liberals tabled a super-motion to ram through back to work legislation. By threatening to legislate them back to work, the Minister undermines any possibility of @cupw Postal Workers getting a fair deal. #canlab #negos2018 Watch/Share on YouTube: 
If Trudeau believes this is a crisis, then let's treat it like a crisis. On #NationalHousingDay the NDP is calling on the Liberals to fast-track funding to build more co-operative not-for-profit housing so Canadians struggling to get by can find relief. 
From Canadians struggling to get by forced into #homelessness, to young Canadians who can never dream about home ownership like their parents did ‚Äì the #HousingCrisis is impacting all of us. Meanwhile, the Liberal Govt tells us to wait for a solution. We can't afford to wait. 
What were you concerned with in high school? This is a group of students in Langford BC ‚Äì and affordable #housing was the main issue they kept bringing up with me. No joke ‚Äì high school kids whose main concern was the #HousingCrisis sweeping our country. #NationalHousingDay 
While most Canadians look for relief from skyrocketing housing medication costs, Justin Trudeau's Liberal gov‚Äôt just gave a $14B blanket tax break to the richest corporations in Canada. We don't need a Santa Claus for the rich. We need to invest in everyday Canadians. #cdnpoli 
Ford's decision to cut services for Francophones in Ontario is wrong. Trudeau criticized that decision. Now it‚Äôs time for him to act by announcing that the Liberal gov't will engage with Ontario to finance the French University project in Toronto. 
The incomparable @harryslaststand is currently hospitalized in Belleville, Ontario. After decades fighting for universal healthcare, Harry has made a tremendous impact on Canada and the UK. On behalf of the NDP family, I send Harry Leslie Smith and his family our love support. 
Canada's cities towns are the fabric of our nation, yet they face real problems ‚Äì from a #HousingCrisis to rural connectivity, the fed govt must go further than election promises provide real support for #CDNmuni. Thanks @FCM_online for your leadership today's conversation. 
So on #NationalChildDay, we stand with the children of Kashechewan First Nation reaffirm our commitment to fighting for safe schools and quality education for all communities ‚Äì because ùó≤ùòÉùó≤ùóøùòÜ kid in Canada deserves it. #WorldChildrensDay 
I also saw the spirit of resilience that the people of #Kashechewan embody ‚Äì a determination to overcome the impacts of colonialism fight for solutions for their children community ‚Äì while Justin Trudeau fails to acknowledge the problem, let alone fix it. #cdnpoli 
These kids told me that what they want more than anything in their school are hallways ‚Äì so they don't have to go from one broken portable to another in freezing cold winter weather. If this was happening in any major city it would be a national story fixed right away. #cdnpoli 
Alongside @CharlieAngusNDP, I saw first-hand the deplorable conditions that children in Kashechewan First Nation are faced with due to severe flooding ‚Äì kids that are just asking for a safe school where they can learn, just like any other kid in Canada. #cdnpoli 
THREAD: On #NationalChildDay, a day meant to reaffirm that all kids deserve dignity respect ‚Äì I'm thinking about the kids of #Kashechewan First Nation. These kids right now in Canada, in 2018, face decrepit unsafe classrooms literally preventing them from an education:

On Transgender Day of Remembrance, we remember those whose lives have been lost to anti-transgender violence. We defend the trans rights that were fought for. And, as we do every day, we work to empower the trans community. #TransRightsAreHumanRights #TDOR 
We absolutely cannot tolerate the forced sterilization of Indigenous women in Canada ‚Äì these human rights violations must be examined at all levels to find out how this happened and who‚Äôs responsible for this abusive and dehumanizing practice. #cdnpoli 
Too many families in Canada are getting left behind and can't keep up, yet the Liberal government continues to say that the economy is doing well. Instead of cutting corporate taxes, the Liberals must start investing in everyday Canadians. #Cdnpoli 
People in Ontario, especially young people, should feel safe being who they are - @OntarioPCParty advanced a motion that seeks to erase diverse gender identities. This is an attack on LGBT gender non-binary people. @AndrewScheer, you were there today. Do you agree with this? 
Franco-Ontarians are being abandoned by their very own government. Ford should reverse these cuts to French Language Services and his allies should call him out. We will continue to fight for the best services available to Francophones across Canada. 
Climate change is the single greatest threat we face Canada is failing to do its part ‚Äì instead we're driving catastrophic #ClimateChange forward. Trudeau must have the courage to act, increase emissions targets invest in clean energy not fossil fuels. 
We were inspired by you Ms. McBain. Your inspirational story and profound love, give us the courage to forge a new path where we care for those who face addictions, poverty and mental health instead of punishing them. 
Very excited to welcome long-time NDP strategist and activist Jennifer Howard as Chief of Staff for the NDP Caucus. The tenacity and strong leadership that she brings to our team will help us make a positive difference in the lives of Canadians. #cdnpoli 
Leslie's story is one of courage and determination to ensure no mother has to deal with the loss she has faced. We need to treat the #OpioidEpidemic as the health crisis it is, and at the same time, have the courage to seek justice for all affected. 
We've seen in the US that criminal pleas restitution can be secured by Governments against opioid manufactures. The Liberals must investigate whether criminal charges against drug companies are possible recoup the enormous cost of the #opioidcrisis. 
Too many Canadians are losing loved ones to the #OpioidEpidemic, while the federal Gov't fails to act drug companies operate with impunity. New Democrats are calling on the Liberals to investigate the role drug companies may have played in fueling the crisis. 
THREAD: In almost every community across Canada there is a mother like Leslie McBain ‚Äì who joined me today in Burnaby ‚Äì that has lost a child to the #OpioidCrisis. Leslie's tragedy led her to fight for solutions ‚Äì today we announced how we're determined to fight alongside her: 
The BC Institute of Tech @BCIT is a great example of higher learning. Along with an Indigenous Services for students, they also offer incredible opportunities around sustainability green energy innovation. It really showed me the potential of a thoughtful approach to education. 
Big salute to Dwane Casey in his return to Toronto tonight! Thank you for raising the bar for all of Canada when it comes to what our @Raptors are capable of ‚Äì let's hope you hear it from the city tonight #WeTheNorth 
The incredible students from Belmont HS in Langford spent the afternoon talking w/ me about the environment, Indigenous rights, reducing homelessness more. The compassion behind each question left me inspired hopeful for the future, knowing we're in good hands for tomorrow 
Today we will have @theJagmeetSingh visit our Indigenous Gathering Place here at #BCIT. We hope he finds our student space warm, comfortable and inviting. Its our honor to have him acquaint with our Indigenous students. 
Canadians should know their vote counts, but when 39% of the vote = 100% of the power, we have a real problem. Trudeau promised a solution but went back on his word, so today we made it clear ‚Äì we will get electoral reform done so Gov't works better for more people. #ProRep #yyj 
He helped me believe that another world was possible Defined by the pursuit of justice He taught me being different wasn‚Äôt a weakness It was my super power He showed me we‚Äôre only limited by our imagination Upward and onward sweet soul, to greater glory #Excelsior #StanLee 
We condemn the escalating violence in #Gaza in the strongest possible terms and call on both sides to respect international law and human rights. Canada must be prepared to help negotiate an end to the worst fighting since 2014 #NDP @NDP #CdnPol 
Like many I collected comics as a kid. I often sought ways to escape from the worries I faced growing up. Stan Lee's imagination built a world where I could lose myself and enjoy carefree moments with unforgettable characters. Thank you Stan Lee, Excelsior! 
Forced sterilization of Indigenous women is a grave human rights violation. The Gov‚Äôt must immediately end this dehumanizing harmful practice in all corners of our country, prevent it, make amends with the survivors hold those responsible accountable.https://t.co/qFMj30MlCV 
As #CanadaRemembers, we pay tribute to those who gave their lives or came home forever changed in defence of our freedom ‚Äì we honour them by never forgetting the terrible cost of war. In their memory, let us recommit ourselves to peace. #LestWeForget 
Not showing up isn‚Äôt standing up for Canadians ‚Äì the thousands of workers being hit by these tariffs need bold leadership willing to delay finalizing the deal until these illegal tariffs are removed ‚Äì they don‚Äôt need empty symbolism. #USMCA 
We must have the courage to stand up to corporate interest say no to privatization ‚Äì that means fighting to expand our public services infrastructure. Thanks @CUPEnat for your leadership in this fight the chance to speak at your National Sector Council Conference. #canlab 
Thanks to @theJagmeetSingh for coming to speak at our @cupenat National Sector Council Conference. With love and courage, we'll fight back against P3s and precarious work, and create a better country for everyone. #NSCC2018

Canada's veterans have had our back ‚Äì and it's our duty to take care of them. Today is a victory for all vets as Parliament passed our motion calling for all budgeted funding for vets to actually be spent on improving the services veterans need deserve. 
Canada's veterans have earned the right to be treated with respect care ‚Äì yet the Liberal Gov't has left over $372M in budgeted funding for Veterans Affairs unspent since taking office. The NDP is demanding that the funding budgeted for veterans is actually spent on veterans: 
New Democrats will push the Liberal government to ensure money budgeted for vets is actually spent on vets ‚Äì because our veterans deserve better. #LestWeForget #cdnpoli 
Canada can do more to ensure democracy prevails in Sri Lanka, including considering the use of the Magnitsky Act to sanction Sri Lankan officials who may be responsible for gross human rights violations. #cdnpoli

Today we join Intl human rights orgs marking the 34th anni of the 1984 #SikhGenocide. We honour the victims, survivors their families in recognizing that truth-telling is necessary for healing reconciling the inter-generational trauma that lives on: 
#JamalKhashoggi Wendi Winters Ali Saleemi John McNamara Sandeep Sharma Just some of those killed in 2018 doing their job. On the Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists,we denounce those who attack and vilify reporters seek justice for those we lost #TruthNeverDies 
There is no reason ‚Äòbearer shares‚Äô should exist in Canada. They‚Äôre untraceable completely anonymous, which is why we saw the ultra-rich use them in the #PanamaPapers to avoid paying taxes. It‚Äôs also why the bad guys in movies like Die Hard want them so badly. #Cdnpoli 
Every day I meet Canadians worried about just getting by, while the ultra-rich use tax loopholes to avoid paying their fair share the Liberals refuse to act. This must end. Today in Toronto's financial district we announced a plan to act on tax fairness: 
Too many Cdns fear losing their pension when a company fails ‚Äì yet the Liberal's proposed changes to 's bankruptcy laws will continue to protect shareholders over pensioners. The Liberals must amend the budget bill to protect workers #EndPensionTheft: 
All for one and one for all, my friends. Happy #Halloween from Ed Broadbent, @GuyCaronNPD and the whole NDP family!! 
We wish we may, we wish we might, enchant you all with orange delight. Happy #Halloween!! 
Too many Canadians still face hardship in their daily lives for criminal records for possession of #Cannabis ‚Äì something that's now legal. And no ‚Äì pardons don't go far enough. New Democrats continue to call for these records to be deleted once for all. 
Canadians in #Outremont, #YorkSimcoe and #BurnabySouth deserve to have a voice. Today the NDP joined a multi-party effort to demand Trudeau do what's best for people in these communities and call the by-elections now: 
Our Canadian glaciers are shrinking at an alarming and unexpected rate. What will we tell our children when they ask why we didn't act? Climate change is the single greatest threat we face. The science is clear ‚Äì we cannot wait. #cdnpoli 
With Trump's illegal tariffs on steel aluminum still on the table, the livelihood of thousands of Canadian workers is on the line. Today I was joined by @SteelworkersCA in urging Trudeau not to sign the #USMCA until these illegal tariffs are lifted. #cdnpoli #canlab 
Prime Minister Trudeau just decided that over 300,000 Canadians in #BurnabySouth, #Outremont #YorkSimcoe don‚Äôt deserve a voice in Parliament. Why? 
My heart breaks for the Jewish community in Pittsburgh after the horrific anti-Semitic attack at a synagogue during prayer. Canadians grieve with the families of the murdered and injured. We also stand strong and united against hate and those who promote it. 
Too many Canadians face skyrocketing housing healthcare costs while the ultra-rich soar ahead. Conservatives don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem Liberals refuse to take action ‚Äì but we don't have to accept it. We can build an economy that works for everyone. 
The #USMCA puts Canadian jobs at risk, makes businesses vulnerable, and prescription drugs more expensive. A new poll shows 47% of Canadians feel the trade deal is a disappointment. How can Trudeau say he is proud of this deal when will pay the price? @traceyram #cdnpoli 
Families devastated by the #opioid crisis deserve justice. It's time for the Liberals to finally launch an investigation into the role played by drug companies in fueling the overdose epidemic in Canada, and to seek meaningful compensation for the public costs of this crisis. 
Excited to welcome Michael Balagus as the NDP‚Äôs interim Chief of Staff. His decades of service and experience across this country will help us make a positive difference in people‚Äôs lives and build towards forming the government Canadians deserve. 
On Tuesday, Justin Trudeau clearly stated that there would be a $1 billion penalty for cancelling the #Saudi arms deal. Today, he's backtracking on that number. Canadians have a right to know: Is the PM making up numbers so he doesn't have to stop an arms deal with Saudi Arabia? 
On #UNDay we remind ourselves that we're all in this together. From the urgency of combatting climate change to dealing with income inequality around the world ‚Äì the work we accomplish together can and will build a better future: 
Too many Canadians are losing loved ones to the #OpioidEpidemic, while the federal government fails to act. These families deserve justice. We‚Äôre calling on the Liberals to investigate the role drug companies may have played in fueling the crisis. #Cdnpoli 
I‚Äôm very excited for @s_malcolmson taking her next step to bring progressive change to the people of Nanaimo. Sheila has worked so hard to get results for people on issues like housing protecting our coast ‚Äì I wish her all the best as she continues this amazing work. 
For 4k low-income residents who signed onto the 3 year Basic Income Pilot Project in ON ‚Äì Premier Ford's decision to scrap the project was devastating. I‚Äôm calling on the Federal Govt to step-in and save the project valuable data for a changing economy.

Saudi Arabia admits Jamal Khashoggi was killed in their consulate, the latest in a long line of human rights abuses. The Liberals must end arms exports to Saudi Arabia call for a UN investigation. We cannot stand idly by, or worse, profit from the atrocities of this regime.

Loving the hardworking vibe in the north ‚Äì I had the pleasure of a tour meeting with mill workers at @EACOMcorp in Timmins with @CharlieAngusNDP and saw first-hand the work that helps drive Ontario's economy forward. 
A transaction fee cap will help small businesses thrive ‚Äì and that means stronger family businesses and stable, good jobs in communities across Canada. This simple measure will give #SmallBusinesses an opportunity to grow. #SmallBusinessWeek 
On #PersonsDay, let's remember honour the Famous Five, a courageous group of women, who intensely fought to make Canada a more equal and inclusive country: 
Here's the letter I've written to @FP_Champagne about Sidewalk Toronto. There are serious concerns, long and short term, about this project. We need much more and better public oversight. 
29 years ago, Parliament unanimously passed the NDP motion to eliminate child poverty in by 2000 ‚Äì yet unacceptable poverty rates remain. Poverty isn't inevitable ‚Äì On #EndPovertyDay, I call on the Liberals to act on real solutions that vulnerable Canadians urgently need. 
12 million ppl in #Yemen face starvation if the bombings don't stop ‚Äì yet the Liberal Government refuses to end the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia, used in this abhorrent onslaught of civilians. This has to stop. Canada must immediately end our sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. 
My bill proposes the expungement of cannabis convictions, while the Libs are offering a pardon process. I'm happy they want to make it expedited free, but Cdns w/ pardons still have to check that 'convicted of criminal offence' box on job housing applications. That's not ok. 
With #CannabisLegalization let's remember that pot has been effectively legal for some Canadians for years while others, predominately Indigenous racialized ppl, are still being punished by criminal records affecting their daily lives. Let's delete these records once for all: 
We can all help in the fight for #ZeroHunger. From more sustainable means of food production reducing food waste, to protecting the ground beneath our feet. On #WorldFoodDay we recommit to doing everything we can to reduce hunger in around the world: 
During #SmallBusinessWeek we celebrate all small medium sized businesses across for driving our economy forward ‚Äì and recognize that more than ever, they need a partner in government that supports them in an ever-changing technology driven economy: 
This past weekend, New Democrats came together in #TroisRivi√®res for our 2018 Quebec Convention. We talked about the environment, the protection of QC culture our dairy producers ‚Äì and it's clear to me that our NDP team in QC has a lot to be proud of ‚úä 
"The Liberals are spending a lot of time attacking the Conservatives for not having a plan for the environment and that‚Äôs true, but the Liberals' emission targets are the exact same as the Harper Conservatives'." ‚Äì NDP Leader @theJagmeetSingh #cdnpoli 
The devastating report from the UN on #ClimateChange is clear: we‚Äôre running out of time. That‚Äôs why today, we‚Äôre asking for an emergency debate to push the government to act now. That means fixing inadequate emission targets and investing in green jobs, not pipelines. #Cdnpoli

Canadians face a #HousingCrisis while the Liberals sit on their hands wait ‚Äì we can't afford to wait. I spent time with the Council of Community Homelessness Tables in Burnaby ‚Äì their work makes it clear that we need to act now kick start the creation of new housing units. 
We‚Äôre facing a #HousingCrisis the Liberals are telling us to wait until after 2019 for 90% of the funding. People can‚Äôt wait. I‚Äôm calling on Trudeau to create a dedicated fund to increase local planning kick start the creation of new units right now: 
On behalf of all New Democrats, I extend my warmest wishes to all those in Canada around the world celebrating Navratri: 
This week I'm in Burnaby BC, where like so many cities across , the cost of finding a home is skyrocketing ‚Äì yet the Liberal Govt refuses to act with the urgency people need. We believe a #HousingCrisis means immediate funding for affordable housing now, not 2 years from now. 
This #IPCC report is clear: we need an unprecedented shift in our approach to fighting climate change now. This is our most important fight ‚Äì Justin Trudeau must understand what‚Äôs at stake and have the political will to act now: 
We have so much to be thankful for in Canada. On this #Thanksgiving, let‚Äôs recommit ourselves to a Canada where no one is left behind‚Äîone where we all have a reason to give thanks. Happy Thanksgiving! 
Special day ‚ù§ 
On this World Teachers‚Äô Day, we thank all of our teachers educators who help shape our present future ‚Äì let us recommit to supporting them and protecting their ability to do their job at the highest level: 
"Asking Indigenous peoples for their opinion, but refusing to hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù is the very definition of paternalism. Does Trudeau only agree with Indigenous rights and title when Indigenous people agree with him?" ‚Äì NDP MP @nathancullen #cdnpoli #TransMountain 
Words can't express my gratitude for the amazing Willy Blomme who is leaving her post as the NDP's Chief of Staff. Willy is brilliant, selfless and determined to make a positive difference in people's lives. Thank you Willy for everything you've done for our party our movement. 
I have officially tabled my private member's bill, C-415, An Act to establish a procedure for expunging certain cannabis-related convictions. This is a bill about righting past wrongs and it will help hundreds of thousands of Canadians get on with their lives. 
Simply put, Canadians shouldn‚Äôt be punished for what will soon be a completely legal activity. Add your name right now to support the NDP's plan to immediately pardon those convicted of simple cannabis possession: 
Too many people face unnecessary barriers for simple possession of cannabis ‚Äì like finding a job or an apartment. These barriers are felt even more by marginalized communities, including Black Canadians Indigenous Peoples, who are 3-9x more likely to be arrested for possession. 
With just 2 weeks until cannabis is legalized in Canada, too many people with criminal records for simple possession still face real hardship. This is why the NDP is putting forward an amnesty bill to immediately expunge these possession records for all Canadians. #Cdnpoli 
1 in 4 Canadians skip necessary prescription medicines because of their cost. Now we learn the new #USMCA will increase prescription drug costs in Canada. Why would Trudeau ever agree to increase drug costs while Canadians are already struggling? ‚Äì NDP MP, @DonDavies #cdnpoli 
Huge congrats to Canada's very own Dr. Donna Strickland on a historic Nobel Prize in physics!! Very cool to learn about her groundbreaking work in the world of laser physics. Today, all Canadians are celebrating your work. 
In October we celebrate #WomensHistoryMonth and recognize the courageous women, past and present, who inspire us to #MakeAnImpact and build a more just and equal world: 
My congratulations to Quebec‚Äôs Premier-designate, @francoislegault. I look forward to working with the new government to defend Quebec's interests in Ottawa. To all of the parties, wishing you a job well done on your campaigns. #electionqc 
Many Canadians were worried we wouldn't get a deal, but today, many of the same Canadians are worried about what we have given up to get this deal. #USMCA The Liberals owe it to Canadians to bring the deal for study debate to parliament. #cdnpoli 
This trade deal is nothing like what the Liberals promised at the beginning of negotiations. The NDP will continue to press the Liberal government to be transparent and will continue to stand up for our workers and industries. #USMCA #cdnpoli 
Canadian workers need their government to fight for trade deals that work for them. With #USMCA, we have a new name, but a worse deal. From concessions that'll hurt our farmers, to making medication more expensive ‚Äì this deal is not the progressive solution Canadians need. 
On #NationalSeniorsDay, let‚Äôs commit to making life better for all seniors in Canada around the world who deserve the utmost care, dignity and respect: 
My thoughts, on this #OrangeShirtDay are with the brother I never knew, Jonnish. Taken away at 6 in 1954 to Residential School, never to come back, like many. I shed tears every year because I can‚Äôt imagine his final moments, that year, without the love of his parents. #Broken 
I was in Grassy Narrows First Nation with @CharlieAngusNDP. We saw the effects of mercury poisoning in the community felt the fierce resilience in the people as they continue to fight for justice. We made a promise to stand with them demand a solution once for all. #cdnpoli 
Thanks to @AIAC_News for inviting me to speak at #AeroDayCanada on the Hill this week. Canada‚Äôs aerospace industry contributes so much to our economy the NDP is committed to taking a strategic, sector-specific approach that invests in aerospace innovation R&amp;D here at home. 
Let's be very clear ‚Äì @RomeoSaganash doesn't need Indigenous rights explained to him by Justin Trudeau. The Prime Minister should take Romeo‚Äôs advice and sit down with Indigenous knowledge keepers so he can understand what free, prior and informed consent really means. #cdnpoli 
We have a 32% pay gap between men women. It‚Äôs worse for women w/ disabilities, Indigenous, and racialized women. If Trudeau is serious about gender equality, why are women still waiting for pay equity? @s_malcolmson #GenderEqualityWeek Add your name: 
The Liberal government's inaction is unacceptable. We are committed to justice for indigenous people ‚Äì that means cleaning the mercury contamination as well as providing more funding for education in the community closing the funding gap for Indigenous children across Canada. 
The decades of inaction on #GrassyNarrows is disgraceful. It represents a betrayal of First Nations people. It is symbolic of colonialism yet another example of the continued devaluing of First Nation, Inuit and M√©tis lives. 
We saw the effects of mercury poisoning in the faces bodies of children, adults and seniors. The land their source of food has been poisoned and the federal government has refused to act and provide solutions. #cdnpoli 
Yesterday, @CharlieAngusNDP I visited #GrassyNarrows First Nation heard first-hand about the impact of mercury contamination in their water. This is a community situated in some of the most beautiful lakes and rivers imaginable and yet the people can't even drink the water. 
The war on drugs has devastated communities, led to mass incarceration, and set the stage for the opioid crisis. But yesterday, Justin Trudeau signed on to renew the worldwide war on drugs. Trying to appease Trump won't help Canadians who are hurting. 
Too many of our fellow citizens have to make the impossible choice of deciding to pay for food, rent or their medication. We need a universal pharmacare system that places the medical needs of Canadians above the profit margins of multinational pharmaceutical companies. 
The Liberals claim their most important relationship is w/ Indigenous peoples. But now we hear there's no guarantee that all concerns on #TransMountain will be addressed. Why are Liberals satisfied w/ the bare minimum when it comes to their most important relationship? @RABlaney 
Horrific effects of mercury on people here. "We are not expendable" - message of the #grassynarrows water team. 
As long as Indigenous women are over-represented in prisons, as long as older women are trapped in poverty women are paid less than men at work as long as women still have to fear having their rights taken away ‚Äì we can‚Äôt be satisfied: #GenderEquity 
At Grassy Narrows with @theJagmeetSingh A region of beautiful lakes but people can't drink the water #nationalcrime 
Sending my best wishes to all the candidates volunteers working hard today for @JenMcKenzieNDP and the @NBNDP_NPDNB, as they push for new ideas better results for the people of New Brunswick. Let's go! #nbvotes 
Thank you to Grand Chief @gcfiddler of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation for today's important discussion ‚Äì the federal government needs to understand the reality that northern communities face when it comes to housing, access to safe clean drinking water, youth suicide and education. 
I am travelling with @theJagmeetSingh to visit the people of #Grassynarrows We will be meeting with the community to see what is needed on the ground. The #NDP continues to push for justice for people of the English-Wabigoon River system. 
The #CycleLife is real‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Thanks to everyone who joined us for our Hamilton bike ride! Canada can be a leader in cycling infrastructure accessibility. Not only can it help with the livability of our communities cities ‚Äì it's also just a lot of fun. #HamOnt 
Thank you @theJagmeetSingh for visiting our campus and speaking with students and our student leaders today! | @MSU_McMaster 
On the #DayofPeace, we celebrate 70 yrs of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today we're reminded that when we protect the fundamental rights of all people, we are stronger ‚Äì and together, we can build a more just fairer world: 
Trudeau made it clear today he intends to force through the expansion of the #TransMountain pipeline. The courts have said the government's consultation process with Indigenous peoples was insufficient ‚Äì now we‚Äôre supposed to give the Liberals a do-over? ‚Äì @MurrayRankin #cdnpoli 
Once again, I am calling on the Trudeau government to abandon the #TransMountain expansion, fully overhaul the NEB review process, and finally demonstrate that it respects the sovereignty of Indigenous Peoples: 
Today's announcement by the Trudeau Gov't makes it clear: Despite no plan to address the Court's ruling that they failed to consult Indigenous peoples or consider the impact on BC's coastline, the Liberal's are going to force through expansion of the #TransMountain pipeline. 
Since 2013 workers at the MANA plant in #HamOnt have been locked out for fighting to protect their pensions wages. Every week, rain or shine, they show up demand better. All Canadian workers deserve better than this. Today every day we stand in solidarity with them. #canlab 
On behalf of New Democrats, I want to extend my best wishes to the Armenian community on Armenia‚Äôs Independence Day! 
Had the honour of visiting the MANA picket line with @theJagmeetSingh and @DaveChrisMP. Our party stands in solidarity with locked out @USW1005 members. @uswdistrict6 @SteelworkersCA @USWHamilton

Petra Shultz was devastated by the loss of her son to an opioid overdose ‚Äì she is not alone. In the first 3 months of 2018 we had 1000 opioid overdose deaths in Canada. When will Trudeau admit his approach is failing decriminalize these substances to save lives? ‚Äì @DonDavies 
Our bridges, roads airports shouldn't be seen as an opportunity to profit from taxpayers for Liberal corporate interests. While people wait for investments that improve our lives, the Infrastructure Bank has little to show for except outrageous expenses. 
.@NDP unequivocally condemns the unspeakable horrors described in @UN Fact-Finding Mission report on Myanmar. Canada must support #ICC efforts to bring justice for the #Rohingya people #cdnpoli 
Giving away bits of our supply management system with each new trade deal is like death by a thousand cuts for #farmers. Enough is enough. We need @JustinTrudeau to FULLY protect supply management. @dfc_plc #cndpoli #NAFTA #naftawatch 
Join NDP Leader @theJagmeetSingh for a bike ride through Hamilton hear about our vision for a National Cycling Strategy in Canada. You can support local cycling infrastructure meet Jagmeet. Don't forget to bring your bike! #CycleLife RSVP now: 
No child should have to beg for the right to quality education in a safe and comfortable classroom. Trudeau owes the children of #Kashechewan First Nation an answer ‚Äì when will he do what's right get these kids off that floodplain and into a safe school? NDP MP @CharlieAngusNDP 
New Democrats want trade deals that benefit all Canadians and address extreme inequality climate change. We will always defend Canadians' jobs, supply management, the auto sector and the right to privacy. #CPTPP 
The Liberal government's #CPTPP is likely to result in more than 58,000 job losses for Canadian workers, particularly in the auto industry and in industries under our supply management system ‚Äì like so many family farms in Quebec and across Canada. 
Canadians are tired of free trade agreements that are negotiated in secret only benefit the richest, at the expense of workers. Today the Liberals blocked Parliament from fully debating the unfair #CPTPP to ram this deal through. It doesn't have to be like this: 
On behalf of all New Democrats, I'm sending our best wishes to the Jewish community in Canada and around the world on the occasion of Yom Kippur. 
The kids of #Kashechewan have the right to education, just like every other kid. The deplorable condition of their classrooms is a disgrace that must be addressed immediately. The strength courage of the youth leaders of Kashechewan First Nation is an inspiration. 
Proud of our @NDP caucus that will continue the debate against the #CPTPP today. Sweeping trade agreements deserve full parliamentary oversight and debate. Canadians are tired of having Libs Cons ram them through only to leave Canadian workers suffering the impacts. 
The job-killing #CPTPP will cost Canadians 58,000 jobs. Canadian workers farmers aren't buying the bogus argument that this deal is good for Canada. When will the Liberal gov't do the right thing take this job-killing trade deal off the table? ‚Äì NDP MP @traceyram #cdnpoli 
Edward's story is one I hear far too often. too many Canadians face big problems while the Liberal Government sit on their hands wait. We can't afford to wait. We're determined to demand better choices from the Liberals now, not a year from now. @GuyCaronNPD 
From skyrocketing housing costs to battling climate change ‚Äì Canadians are disappointed. While the Liberals keep making empty promises they won't keep, and Conservatives fight over just how anti-immigrant they are, New Democrats are standing up for what matters most to Canadians. 
This week, the Liberals will try to ratify the #TPP11 ‚Äì an unfair trade deal which experts say will result in 58k job losses have deep impacts on our auto industry. New Democrats don't oppose trade, we simply want trade agreements that are fair to our workers their families.

The housing crisis is raging across Canada, meanwhile almost 90% of the Liberal Government's funding is delayed until after the next election. Immediate funding new social housing units are needed right now. Housing is a human right it's time act: 
Last week in Burnaby I met a resident named Edward. A senior who has worked all his life, had two hip replacements is now on disability support. He'll be homeless in 2 weeks, as landlords keep turning him away once they find out about his situation. It shouldn't be like this: 
Today we're joining with kids of Kashechewan First Nation ‚Äì they're here in Ottawa because their classrooms have fallen apart while the Liberals have spent years fighting Indigenous kids in court ‚Äì and still have failed to close the 30% funding gap. 
Canadians are faced with big problems right now ‚Äì and they're tired of watching this Liberal Govt sit on their hands wait. New Democrats are starting this fall united in our determination to fight for solutions people need. Here's what we're focused on: #cdnpoli 
With a wage gap that's widening, skyrocketing housing prices health care not covering everyone the way it should ‚Äì it's time to demand better for #BurnabySouth all of Canada. It‚Äôs time to stop the empty talk get things done that people need. Join me: 
People in Burnaby South all of Canada are facing real struggles while the Liberal Govt sit on their hands wait. We can‚Äôt afford to wait. We're determined to make people's lives better. So today, I'm excited to accept the nomination as the @NDP candidate in #BurnabySouth. 
.@NDP Leader @theJagmeetSingh and I retrace the steps taken by our beloved Jack Layton who visited Crystal Mall in South #Burnaby 13 years ago. Great continuity of strong #NDP support in the community! 
Please watch and share. These conditions are not acceptable in a country as rich as Canada. The children from Kashechewan are coming to Ottawa for a rally at noon on Monday. 
On #DemocracyDay, as the people of Ontario grapple with the suspension of their democratic rights under Premier Ford, let us recommit to standing up for democratic principles around the world and demand a better voting system here at home: #ProRep 
Canadians want solutions to big problems ‚Äì from skyrocketing housing costs to climate change ‚Äì people are disappointed with broken promises. It doesn't have to be this way. Yesterday in Burnaby, I spoke with residents shared our commitment to make people's lives better. 
I tracked down one of the protesters kicked out of Queen's Park yesterday. Ester Reiter, a 77.5 year old, says her Jewish identity is central to why she so vocally took a stand against the "destruction of democracy." 
New Democrats are deeply troubled by Premier Doug Ford's use of the #NotWithStanding Clause. We've formally requested an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee on Justice to determine how we can work with provinces to protect the rights of Canadians: 
Wishing the best of luck to the #HumboldtBroncos as they play their first regular season game tonight! Our hearts are with the team, the families and the community as we remember those we lost, and together, look ahead to an exciting season. #Humboldtstrong 
We can do better. People are looking for less divisiveness in our politics, more collaboration. People deserve a voting system that is more fair, more representative, more inclusive. #prorep 
And despite promising Canadians that 2015 would be the last election under our current voting system, Prime Minister Trudeau broke his promise and failed to deliver the change Canadians asked for with electoral reform. #ERRE 
False majority governments, like Ford‚Äôs, lead to big "policy lurch" extreme changes as we‚Äôre seeing with #Bill5. This is wasteful, inefficient creates instability. Consensus building through #prorep coalitions = better policy outcomes. 
Governments shouldn‚Äôt have 100% of the power with only 40% of the vote. Huge numbers of voters in Ontario are not represented under the ‚Äòfalse majority‚Äô government of Doug Ford. Our current voting system encourages distorted outcomes like this. #onpoli #topoli 
Voters shouldn‚Äôt have to hold their noses choose the least bad option. Voters deserve to have choices that reflect their values, to be able to vote *for* something. There are so many ways in which the current voting system fails voters. #pr4bc 
Too many people are shut out of our current voting system. Too many people don‚Äôt think their vote counts. Bringing in proportional representation would change that. BC‚Äôs electoral reform referendum this fall could have a big impact. 
THREAD: People in British Columbia have a big opportunity ahead ‚Äì to change the way we vote for good. #bcpoli Bringing in proportional representation will make our democracy fairer for everyone ‚Äì our politics more about people. BC can lead the way: #pr4bc #cdnpoli 
Our NDP team is here in Surrey to talk about what's actually going on in people's lives today how we plan to fight for solutions Canadians need right now. It's time to end the betrayals from a Liberal govt that refuses to do what people need demand better for all Canadians. 
This is completely unacceptable!Every single trade deal has thrown our Supply Managed Sector under the bus- Liberals promised to defend supply management- another betrayal. #NAFTA 
Time and again, we've seen the Liberals put the interests of the super-rich ahead of everyday people. When you follow the money ‚Äì it's no surprise. People need someone who is on their side, and the NDP is determined to get the solutions people need now. 
On behalf of all New Democrats, I would like to extend my warmest wishes to everyone celebrating a peaceful and joyous Nayrouz! 
Good morning from Surrey, BC! We're starting day 1 of 3 with our NDP team, working on our plan to fight for solutions people urgently need right now. We're determined to make a real difference for more people, because Canadians haven't received the help they need. #cdnpoli 
On the anniversary of the deadliest terrorist attack in US history, we remember all those who tragically lost their lives on 9/11, and honour the bravery and courage shown by so many on that day and the days that followed: 
Today's decision by the Ontario Superior Court judge underlines the severely undemocratic nature of Premier Doug Ford's Bill 5 #topoli To everyone who organized spoke out, and all the candidates who refused to give up, #Toronto is stronger because of you. 
Kids in Kashechewan First Nation can‚Äôt start the school year because of dilapidated classrooms families across Canada face soaring healthcare housing costs ‚Äì yet the Liberal govt refuses to act while Canada's ultra-rich do laps around the rest of us. 
Wishing all those celebrating #RoshHashanah a sweet new year! May it be filled with good health, happiness, peace and prosperity. #ShanaTova 
Antisemitism has no place in Canada. I know what it‚Äôs like to experience racism discrimination, and to have my loyalty to Canada questioned. @LevittMichael and @AHousefather, I stand with you today. 
Conservative and Liberal governments have repeatedly failed to meaningfully consult. We need to get this process right and truly act on the duty to consult. Indigenous communities have waited too long. 
Trudeau claims his most important relationship is with Indigenous peoples ‚Äì but the way he's pushed forward with #TransMountain makes that hard to believe. Today the Liberals voted down our plan to fix the flawed consultation process with First Nations: 
Lise Payette was an inspiration ‚Äì an ardent feminist, journalist, author and media pioneer who fought for fairness and equality under the law. Her legacy will have a lasting impact on generations to come in Quebec. 
@theJagmeetSingh and I are calling on @JustinTrudeau to deliver on key priorities for the constituents of Saskatoon West. With so many struggling to make ends meet, our communities and our neighbourhoods deserve it. Read our letter: 
The more Canadians learn, the clearer it is that buying this pipeline hasn't been good for workers, the environment, or our economy. The only ones benefiting are the shareholders of Kinder Morgan. #TransMountain 
We must overhaul the review process for energy projects invest the billions that would have gone into expanding the pipeline into clean, renewable energy that would help us meet our climate change targets. This would also create jobs for today‚Äôs workers future generations. 
Today I am calling on the Liberal government to abandon the #TransMountain Pipeline expansion and stop fighting First Nations and Canadians in the courts. #cdnpoli 
Happy #LabourDay from Toronto!! Workers have been, and will continue to be, at the centre of the work we do as New Democrats. In solidarity, let's keep fighting for a more just world and a fairer economy for all Canadians #CanLab 
On #LabourDay, New Democrats are proud to stand in solidarity with hard-working Canadians who are the backbone of our economy. Today and everyday, let's recommit ourselves to building a fair economy that works for people, not for Bay Street: #canlab 
And given the threat of even more tariffs, I call again on the prime minister to urgently create a National Task Force on Tariffs to plan and coordinate support for affected workers, communities and industries. 
Trump is trying to force a bad deal on Canadians, and our government is right to take the time it needs to get this deal right. Like we‚Äôve said all along we need a deal that protects Canadian workers and industry. #NAFTA 
If we really want to stop hate, we need to do more than just call it out. Growing economic inequality creates the conditions for hate to fester. That‚Äôs the reality Scheer is trying to exploit Prime Minister Trudeau has failed to address with action: 
Today‚Äôs decision is deeply important for our country and for our future. It confirms what many FN communities and Canadians have been saying all along. The Liberal govt has once again failed to live up to its promise its obligation to adequately consult Indigenous communities. 
Today‚Äôs unanimous federal court decision makes it clear ‚Äî the Liberals didn‚Äôt adequately consult Indigenous communities on #TransMountain didn‚Äôt consider the impact of marine tanker traffic on the environment, something I know Canadians, especially in BC are very worried about. 
Long overdue vindication for our MP Christine Moore @MooreNpd with this apology from the CBC. They apologized because they did not wait for her side of the story and the column they published did not meet their editorial standards. 
Sending many thanks to local business operators across Canada on #CStoreDay! As convenience stores raise funds today for @Childrens_wish, we wish them all the best on their big day thank all the participants and customers across Canada for helping with such an incredible cause. 
NAFTA must protect promote Canadian cultural content -- especially Francophone content -- and production. Like the local businesses I visited in Drummondville (QC) that helped me understand just how critical it is to support local innovators, producers and content creators. 
The government can‚Äôt sign on to a deal that doesn‚Äôt protect public services like healthcare. And NAFTA can‚Äôt leave Canadians paying even more for the medication they need, or stop Canada from finally introducing a universal pharmacare plan. 
NAFTA can‚Äôt allow foreign companies and investors to sue us over environmental regulations that get in the way of their profits. This is about being able to protect and preserve our environment now and for future generations. 
Any deal must support local small family farms rural communities ‚Äì like the farmers I met in Essex, who need to know that their government has their back right now. 
A NAFTA that‚Äôs good for people explicitly protects jobs, fair labour standards and wages. We can‚Äôt let this be a race to the bottom for workers. NAFTA needs to protect auto jobs and put an end to Trump's tariff threats. 
Uncertainty around #NAFTA Trump‚Äôs tariffs have left Canadians worried about their jobs how much harder it‚Äôll be just to pay for the basics like groceries. 
There‚Äôs no question that negotiating with Trump isn‚Äôt easy. But we can‚Äôt be bullied into a bad deal for Canadians. #NAFTA The government must fight for what‚Äôs best for people, not just for what‚Äôs good for Bay St ‚Äì and there's a lot at stake: 
Quebecers have made it clear that we must end the preferential tax treatment received by web giants. It is a priority for New Democrats to fight for fairness for Canadians and ensure the same rules apply for everyone ‚Äì and that means web giants paying income tax in Canada. 
Today I'm in Montreal, alongside our Quebec caucus, to speak directly to the people of Quebec who are tired of seeing web giants get away without paying their fair share in taxes. As a matter of fairness for Canadian companies, we must demand better from the Liberal government. 
I want to thank @LindaDuncanMP for her tireless work throughout her career in fighting for the people of Edmonton Strathcona, AB all of Canada. Linda's passion knowledge as a defender of the environment and Indigenous rights will continue to inspire me, and all New Democrats. 
Canadians are already suffering from the impacts of Trump‚Äôs erratic trade policy. We're calling on Trudeau to strike a National Task Force on Tariffs so that govt, businesses and workers can work together to defend our Canadian jobs industries. #NAFTA 
A great debt of gratitude is owed to @IreneMathyssen for her lifelong commitment to advancing women‚Äôs rights and on the #right2housing homelessness prevention. Thank you, Irene, for serving the people of London ‚Äì Fanshawe, Ontario and all of Canada with dedication integrity. 
Senator John McCain had the courage not to stoop to divisive politics. He showed us that we can disagree in a way that creates dialogue and discussion, not fear and division. Rest In peace. 
Tragic news of a shooting out of Jacksonville, Florida. My thoughts are with all those impacted by such senseless violence, along with all first responders during this difficult time. 
#CPC18 delegates voted in favour of ending birthright citizenship for children born in Canada unless one parent is Canadian or a permanent resident. Even Trump has resisted this idea. The NDP unequivocally condemns the division hate being peddled by @AndrewScheer the CPC. 
Today, on behalf of all New Democrats, I wish the Ukrainian community in Canada around the world a happy Independence Day! 
The people of BC need our help right now. lives are at risk and homes are being evacuated. #BCWildfires Fire crews from across Canada are helping out people need our support and care. Gurkiran I just donated to the Red Cross ‚Äì if you can, donate here: 
Great to see @s_malcolmson speaking to British Columbians disappointed with the Liberals on enviro leadership affordable housing. We're determined to invest in create clean energy jobs for today and tomorrow, and pressure the govt to get solutions people urgently need. 
As we reflect on #BlackRibbonDay, let‚Äôs reaffirm our belief in human rights, and recommit ourselves to never standing by in the face of suffering: 
Seven years later and Jack‚Äôs words still ring true. In fact, to meet the rising tide of politics which seek to divide, now more than ever, we need to be more loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we‚Äôll change the world. Rest in strength, Jack. 
"My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we‚Äôll change the world." ‚Äì Jack Layton 
And in Montreal, with this initiative, innovators in Quebec are building a clean energy economy. Instead of spending billions of public dollars on old pipelines, the government should be supporting those creating clean energy jobs for today and tomorrow. 
Just finished a week-long tour in Quebec highlighting exciting clean energy initiatives already underway there. From a biofuel plant in St-Hyacinthe, to Aeronergie in Drummondville, to the Centre de la Nature du Mont Saint-Hilaire. 
Today I extend my warmest wishes to all those observing Eid al-Adha ‚Äì may this be a joyous occasion for renewal, reflection and celebration. Eid Mubarak! 
Devastating scenes out of Kerala - my thoughts are with all those impacted by the flooding, along with all aid rescue workers helping to save lives. 
At the end of the day, we all just want to feel like we belong. Who you love shouldn‚Äôt make you feel like you belong any less. Happy Pride Montreal! #loveislove #PrideMTL Ô∏è‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è 
On #WorldHumanitarianDay, we recommit ourselves to empowering the voiceless, supporting those in need, and pushing for help for those affected by humanitarian crises around the globe: 
Many of our friends and neighbours in the BC Northwest are facing hardship devastating loss due to wildfires. BC govt announced that they will match ALL donations to Red Cross to help folks out in their time of need. Please take a minute to help. 
Today, on the 76th anniversary of the #Dieppe Raid, we honour the courage of all the soldiers who fought, and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice or came home forever scarred. Today and everyday, we will remember you: #LestWeForget 
Kofi Annan‚Äôs courage lifelong dedication to building a better world was truly inspiring. In the face of conflict international turmoil, he championed peace encouraged diplomacy. He will be greatly missed by many. Sending my deepest condolences to his family loved ones. 
I'll be marching in Montr√©al Pride on Sunday! #PrideMTL Join me and let's celebrate show support for the LGBTQ2 community ‚Äì and let's have some fun while we're at it More info: 
The team at the Centre de la Nature du Mont Saint-Hilaire (QC) is incredible. For 40+ yrs, their work to balance conservation initiatives with sustainable development has drawn Int'l recognition is essential to building a healthy future. Thanks for bringing me out @MattDube! 
Our tax system favours the wealthy, meanwhile everyone else is feeling the squeeze ‚Äì from soaring housing prices to out-of-pocket healthcare costs ‚Äì it doesn't have to be this way. We can close tax loopholes so the wealthiest contribute their fair share. 
I was also able to meet with @RoseDrummond, the largest flower growers in Quebec and a driving force in their local economy. Check it out - local rose essence vinegar made right in Drummondville! Supporting local economies looking out for our environment go hand in hand. 
Had a great time with our incredible MP @F_Choquette in Drummondville (QC) meeting with Aeronergie, a local business whose mission is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Innovative solutions like this help keep our environment healthy for today tomorrow's generation. 
Georgina has been working tirelessly towards reconciliation for many years. When Indigenous women do this kind of important work, we must listen and respect that work. @GeorginaNDP 
I have deep respect for @ElizabethMay, her dedication to the environment and making every vote count. I want to thank her for the courtesy she has extended. The people of #BurnabySouth need someone who's going to pressure the govt for the solutions they urgently need right now. 
Our thoughts are with all British Columbians who have been impacted by the #BCwildfires. Thank you to all fire crews, first responders, and everybody who is doing what they can to protect and care for each other right now. 
Alongside our MP @bsansoucynpd, I had the pleasure of visiting the biofuel plant in St-Hyacinthe. This type of eco-friendly innovation in bioenergy production is a great example of investments we can make for today tomorrow. 
Thank you to our incredible MP @RE_Brosseau for showing me around Lake St-Pierre in Berthier‚ÄîMaskinong√© earlier this week! The fact is, the lake‚Äôs ecosystem is under serious threat ‚Äì and we need to do everything we can to protect our waterways in Quebec and across Canada. 
On behalf of all New Democrats, I would like to extend my warmest wishes to everyone around the world celebrating Korean Independence Day: 
I'm deeply disappointed in @AndrewScheer. His refusal to denounce these divisive comments sends a dangerous message. Children of diverse backgrounds across Canada pick up on these messages. Right now, they need to hear that their country wants more of themselves, not less. 
Diversity is the fisherman in Prince Edward County passing his business onto a young refugee. Diversity is the response we saw from people in Quebec City following the mosque shooting. Diversity is knowing that beyond Indigenous Peoples, all Canadians are immigrants. 
In a time when the voices against diversity are getting stronger, we must do more to embrace and empower the voiceless. More diversity will not destroy what it means to be Canadian ‚Äì it is foundational to who we are, it is a fundamental Canadian value. 
To those who feel targeted by these comments, I want you to know that you're very much Canadian, and you strengthen all of us. Canada‚Äôs identity is based on inclusion, and our unyielding belief in lifting each other up in response to attempts to divide us. 
When you are told by some that Canada wants less of you, I understand the isolation you feel. I understand the uncertainty, risk, vulnerability and pain it creates. Comments like these make you feel like there's something wrong with you, for just being you. 
THREAD: I‚Äôve waited to respond to Maxime Bernier's comments to see if @AndrewScheer would do the responsible thing denounce these divisive words. He has not. To everyone that belongs to a diverse community ‚Äì who's been told you don‚Äôt belong ‚Äì I‚Äôve been in your shoes, I get it. 
On behalf of all New Democrats, I would like to wish all Acadians, near and far, a Happy National Acadian Day as we celebrate their heritage and culture: 
As long as we have Canadians sleeping out in the cold, patchwork solutions will not cut it ‚Äì we must demand better. New Democrats stand with over 170 organizations leaders in calling for Trudeau to legislate the #Right2Housing for all Canadians. 
Jagmeet Singh has begun a week-long tour in Quebec. From August 12th to 19th, @theJagmeetSingh will hear directly from Quebecers to promote and highlight the innovations taking place in Quebec within the renewable energy sector. 
Really looking forward to this week's tour in Quebec. This is an important opportunity to talk about our plan for a future in clean energy, and how our communities can benefit from investments in clean energy jobs for today tomorrow. 
It's clear that Mr. Scheer didn't watch the interview. In it, I make my priorities clear ‚Äì we must end the sale of military weapons to Saudi Arabia, and invest in clean energy for the future. But given his Party's record on human rights and the environment, it's no wonder.

@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Goes against interests of all Texans 
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Wow, this is crazy 
@NuovaRealta If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day 8, that‚Äôs fine 
To be clear, orders are fully refundable, even after you‚Äôve had your Tesla for a week 
Reminder to buy our S3XY cars before midnight on Monday! Prices rise slightly worldwide on Tuesday. You can order online at 
@lexiheft @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Definitely down the road, once construction upgrades aren‚Äôt so crazy 
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla This causes some media confusion, as batch builds ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month terrible following month, but consumer tastes don‚Äôt actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules. 
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations we try to build in batches to simplify production 
@dave_ross @Tesla Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer 
@TrevorMahlmann @Tesla @PopMech Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that‚Äôs a lot of complexity. 
@ColinRossUBC827 @Tesla @PopMech Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy regions. 
@Tesla @PopMech Still get this question a lot, even though Norway has highest Tesla cars per person on (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice. 
‚ÄúHow does the Tesla Model 3 do in the snow? Amazingly.‚Äù @PopMech experiences Track Mode in snow

@DMC_Ryan Sure, that would be great 
@TonyTesla4Life @tesla_truth @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Sure 
@TonyTesla4Life @tesla_truth @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Correct 
@fredsa @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla That‚Äôs the plan 
@Syntality @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Of course 
@FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla In retrospect, lower price shouldn‚Äôt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn‚Äôt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday. 
@johnny0129 However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak 
@johnny0129 We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference ‚Äî about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team board. 
@jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don‚Äôt want to write Tesla a check. So it goes. 
@marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too 
Applies worldwide 
Tesla car prices go up ~3% next week, except for $35k Model 3. Order online at before then for current prices. 
@teslaownersSV @Jays200 @Tesla Couldn‚Äôt resolve all the rights issues. Will add another racing game soon. 
@Erdayastronaut @somepitch Yeah, it might break 
@MFrunker @cleantechnica Software release later this week should make it better 
@cleantechnica True (sigh) 
@cleantechnica True 
@Drew78823936 @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon Dragon, although they‚Äôre critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term. 
@DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesn‚Äôt have same safety criticality as crew. 
@dmk184 @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface 
@iamkostmos @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Most likely, but this is contingent upon NASA review approval 
@xandriteme @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Best to use a giant brake pad, aka heat shield 
@NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Dragon 2 was designed to land using thrusters, with parachutes as backup. Switched to chutes as primary, due to difficulty of proving safety, but Dragon can still do it.

@comeaujo @ValueAnalyst1 @Tesla Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time 
@flcnhvy We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues then begin buildout worldwide. 
Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput. 
Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%. 
@PolyBork So true ü§£ 
Extremely important merch 
@CopticChad @Erdayastronaut @privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running, as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (&amp; rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm) 
@MM2LLC Yes, but an engine shouldn‚Äôt count until it flies 
@compdemon Ukraine did play a major role 
@Erdayastronaut @privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla Very little power only right before you get to the Supercharger. You won‚Äôt notice it in range. 
@privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power 
Russia has excellent rocket engineering best engine currently flying. Reusable version of their new Angara rocket would be great.

@Sofiaan @royalflushGK Will take a few days for system update 
@TonyCrisostomo @tesla_truth @royalflushGK Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back. 
@abhaygupta @royalflushGK It‚Äôs not exactly symmetric, but it will come with HW3 upgrade long-term

@katlinegrey @lrocket @Alexis_wwww Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It‚Äôs 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder. 
@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel. 
@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Yes, exciting potential 
@flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly 
NASA gives SpaceX the go-ahead for Crew Dragon‚Äôs first launch into Earth orbit 
@annerajb @lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can‚Äôt print yet. 
@DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight. 
@lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX‚Äôs success. Great respect appreciation! 
Just rolled past 50,000 miles in Apollo in 2ish years. If you sent me back in time, I'd buy the same exact car. The curse of the P100D test drive is absolutely real. If you live in an area with any sort of charging infrastructure... 10/10 would recommend

@flcnhvy @rogiermaas @SpaceX Focusing on Starship instead 
@rogiermaas @SpaceX Deorbits burns up over the Pacific 
@Erdayastronaut @CanzyD Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads Dragon abort thrusters. 
@SpaceXUpdates @CanzyD Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so 
@nextspaceflight Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That‚Äôs scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big. 
@CanzyD High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life.

The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done. 
@DanAloni @Kell31213876 @Vadim15258417 @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun.

@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos 
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Pinter injector tends to have hot cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion. 
@benoitdenayer @navincho @katlinegrey Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars. 
@RichPitre_CO @katlinegrey We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done 
@Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ‚ò∫Ô∏èHigh engine chamber pressure and ablative don‚Äôt get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage. 
@sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey That‚Äôs true Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there. 
@Erdayastronaut @MarekCyzio @katlinegrey Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for ‚Äúlaunch capability‚Äù. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that. 
@Geopilot @katlinegrey Don‚Äôt know 
@katlinegrey SpaceX commercial launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. 
@martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That‚Äôs the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species. 
@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I‚Äôm worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics. 
@wonderofscience So true ü§° John Clarke 
@macodiseas @katlinegrey Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure temperature in oxygen preburner 
@Tom_Heats @coindesk Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification 
@coindesk That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don‚Äôt have any crypto holdings. 
@katlinegrey I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes. 
Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.

@McMurchie @SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship‚Äôs success 
@epoxy101 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX At least 10X cheaper 
@SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Very dependent on volume, but I‚Äôm confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth move to Mars if they want. 
@Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX This will sound implausible, but I think there‚Äôs a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9 
@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close 
@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter. 
@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics. 
@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy. 
@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky. 
@13ericralph31 @SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber several with only preburners 
@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX About 11 secs 
@alexmd2 @SpaceX Definitely! It‚Äôs amazing that the RD-170 RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering. 
Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by @SpaceX engine/test team!

First Model 3 deliveries in Europe 
@Erdayastronaut @LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi Booster center of mass is much lower more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry 
@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality! 
@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Rocket booster temperatures won‚Äôt go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.

@SpaceXFan97 @wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up. 
@wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Mostly true 
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps main engines for landing orientation, so won‚Äôt need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably. 
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton). 
Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at @SpaceX Texas 
@Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes. It‚Äôs very rare to find all three. 
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 To be clear, I‚Äôm confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature reduced need for heat shielding 
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9 
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime angle of attack 
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Absolutely. You‚Äôve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.

@Robotbeat @zackpio Actual tanks are fine 
@Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel. 
@nextspaceflight @Teslarati I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair. 
@Teslarati 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp

@musicnick1985 @Teslarati Teslarati is very thoughtful well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX 
@nextspaceflight @Teslarati The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication 
@Teslarati The source info is incorrect. Starship Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport.

Tesla = Hottest Place To Work For Young Job Seekers 
Good summary of Tesla progress in 2018 by @cleantechnica (due to Tesla team, not me though) via @cleantechnica 
1/ In 2018 we added over 3,100 Superchargers globally. Our network now covers 99% of the US population and 97% of Europe and will continue to grow in 2019 
Model 3 general assembly from start to finish 
@Ben757677 @vincent13031925 Thanks Tesla owners in China! Looking forward to visiting soon for the groundbreaking of Gigafactory Shanghai! 
@Grimezsz Turns out if you take Dayquil, you exit The Matrix 
When one of the interns working on the simulation drops the ball ‚Ä¶ 
The Most Trusted Company For Self-Driving Tech? Tesla ‚Äî By Far 
Excited to have Larry Ellison Kathleen Wilson-Thompson join the Tesla board! 
In addition to the Supercharger network, we have 11,000 Destination Charging locations globally that enable long-distance travel 
.@HenryEPayne tested more than 60 vehicles for us this year. Here's what he loved the most: 
@westcoastbill Tesla team did a great job! 
@SeanABragg @EcoHeliGuy @13ericralph31 @NCBirbhan @AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis I will provide a detailed explanation in March/April 
@EcoHeliGuy @13ericralph31 @NCBirbhan @AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis Time. Although it also turned out to be dramatically better. 
@13ericralph31 @NCBirbhan @AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis Exactly 
@13ericralph31 @AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis Probability at 60% rising rapidly due to new architecture 
@demishassabis Congratulations 
@ckgaparajita Coming soon 
@5AllanLeVito Got it 
@motorsep Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville across Mexico. 
Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey. 
@JT_Richards @MMelinot @chuckyyyd This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car. 
Most people don‚Äôt know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China 
@martinmeany We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings 
@JT_Richards @MMelinot @chuckyyyd This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car. 
Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options: 
And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it‚Äôs electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements. 
There are also many state local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc 
Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days! Order online at to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores. 
Merry Christmas goodwill to all!! ‚õÑÔ∏è 
@AndrewSamoylich @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison No, Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry. Although, maybe not ...

@cleantechnica Sigh 
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Leeward side needs nothing, windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane, so will appear liquid silver even on hot side

@grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Starship will look like liquid silver 
@Kristennetten @rokosslav @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Maybe 
@rokosslav @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Much less 
@grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity.

@Robotbeat @Jon128123 @Diver2441 @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @alan1bernard SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions. 
@BENBALLER Thanks! 
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard It‚Äôs embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant 
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard You def don‚Äôt want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That‚Äôs not a typo. 
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level. 
@NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month. 
@Erdayastronaut @ludan27 @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem. 
@_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word ‚Äústar‚Äù or ‚Äúlink‚Äù 
@ludan27 @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons Mars. 
@John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Coldformed at cryo 
@Malcolmmarsman @TheMuddySchmuck @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height diameter. 
@TheMuddySchmuck @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard We‚Äôre building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there 
@thescalex @Jonas123denmark @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Exactly 
@martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry. 
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we‚Äôre building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April 
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel we‚Äôre using a different alloy mix. I super ‚ô•Ô∏è 300 Series Stainless! 
@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design 
@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized. 
@wangmeister If Tesla committed delivery customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference 
@alan1bernard Coming soon 
@wangmeister It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end 
@MikeKasprzik @Tesla Try connecting to WiFi 
Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can‚Äôt take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less. Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. Order online at or visit stores.

@JohnKasich Thanks, will consider next year 
Elon Musk dreams of one day opening a high-speed tunnel system under L.A. to ease congestion. Here's a look at his company's first test tunnel. 
@nichegamer @boringcompany So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this won‚Äôt matter for the first few layers 
Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in 2 mins with a few taps. No more need to call! 
As a thank you to Tesla short sellers, we named a after them haha 
Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference: 
Join our underground movement! 
@DeadstockNYC Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) tow or flatbed it out 
WATCH: @ElonMusk and @GayleKing test drove the tunnel he hopes will solve L.A. traffic: 
Hopped in my @Tesla this morning and was delighted to find ‚Äúromance mode‚Äù and a drop-down list of juicy, on demand fart noises, that can be triggered with a wheel click or turn signal. The best keeps getting better. Thanks @elonmusk and team! 
@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla Autopilot doesn‚Äôt need the guide wheels. They‚Äôre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future. 
Are tunnels safe in an earthquake? 
@Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly 
@Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly 
@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume. 
@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees. 
@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp elevator. Latter only for tight spaces. 
@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators I think they‚Äôre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument. 
@FredericLambert @boringcompany You‚Äôre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn‚Äôt include it. We‚Äôre working on one that makes things clear. 
@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk! 
@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St. 
The only way to describe my experience going through the new #boringtunnel was EPIC! @elonmusk's solution to solve "soul-crushing" traffic is one step closer to being a reality. @boringcompany @cheddar 
If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles let people decide what makes them happy 
A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated belted for high speed safety. 
Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h). 
The Boring Company Loop system 
@joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany Precisely 
Presentation starting at 8:15 
@CasPiancey @boringcompany This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go 
The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination then drives on normal roads back to start 
@flaneur @boringcompany Actually way more capacity, way faster way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it‚Äôs time to upgrade to something better. 
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians cyclists 
Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city. 
This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla

@kirstenkorosec @TechCrunch @boringcompany Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport 
@Model3Owners Same applies to those who didn‚Äôt order PUP 
@TweetReinhard @TechCrunch Exactly. It‚Äôs a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development! 
@oc_isly @TechCrunch Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago! 
@TechCrunch Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers cell phones. It takes many design iterations vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability. 
Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX Tesla! 
@realrobcopeland @SpaceX Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiel‚Äôs Founder‚Äôs Fund: ‚Äúwe have no concerns whatsoever.‚Äù

@Malcolmmarsman Seems likely that we‚Äôll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though ‚öæÔ∏è 
Here's what @elonmusk really said about the situation with Tesla's board during the 60 minutes interview 
@business Incorrect. ‚ÄúChairman‚Äù is an honorific, not executive role, which means it‚Äôs not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut ‚Äúprovided I have the support of shareholders‚Äù. 
@annerajb About 10 to 14 days 
Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked) 
Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks. To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can‚Äôt deliver your car this year. 
@erikstorli No need to wait. It‚Äôs super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same. 
@lgebman I‚Äôm dying to make a pickup truck so bad ‚Ä¶ we might have a prototype to unveil next year 
Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don‚Äôt believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don‚Äôt need to be. 
@vincent13031925 @teslectrics @60Minutes @MKBHD Probably next month 
@teslectrics @60Minutes You‚Äôre right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story. 
@javagiri @Tesla We‚Äôre opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week. 
@fluffypony @Tesla Probably end of next year 
@DOfaquarius @ElonsBrain @LiveBit_io @60Minutes So true ü¶ô‚ú® 
@60Minutes This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence. 
@JohnnaCrider1 @mundanemun @mayemusk @60Minutes @LesleyRStahl @Tesla @cleantechnica 60 Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to 14 mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party.

Already testing traffic lights, stop signs roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all. 
If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars takes highway interchanges off-ramps. 
@danwat1234 It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car. 
Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn‚Äôt exist or would have started much later. 
@nichegamer Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe later China. 
@brandonorselli Buying took over a decade, $11M amazing amount of effort. Didn‚Äôt like even when we were only making . 
Tesla history trivia: we didn‚Äôt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He‚Äôd originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later.

@DJSnM Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump lines. 
@Dragonmaurizio We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission 
@markkrieger Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad.

@bonnienorman @carpenter_maas Good advice 
@EESNY @teslaownersSV @S100Dfan Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We‚Äôre also working on vision-only driving. 
@nikesharora @Tesla Glad you‚Äôre ok 
@carpenter_maas Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth. 
@carpenter_maas As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic.

@highspeeddoc @boringcompany We‚Äôre doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but we‚Äôre just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead.

@NBCNews This is completely backwards. Based on what we‚Äôve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we‚Äôre moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won‚Äôt need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda. 
You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today, but in a few years summon will work from across the continent. 
Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive.

Just in the nick of time: My brackets have never been my one shining moment, but here we go again. You can check out my #MarchMadness picks here: 
And here are some ways to help cyclone victims in Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe: 
The floods in the Midwest and in southern Africa are heartbreaking. Suffering and loss on two sides of the world calls for solidarity and strength from all of us. Ask what you can do to help our fellow Americans and families in need. Here are some ideas: 
In 2011, I visited the tiny town of Moneygall and got to walk around in the house where my great-great-great grandfather Falmouth Kearney lived his early life. I'll always be grateful for the warmth and generosity of the Irish people. Happy St. Patrick's Day! -Barack O‚ÄôBama 
Michelle and I send our condolences to the people of New Zealand. We grieve with you and the Muslim community. All of us must stand against hatred in all its forms. 
.@MichelleObama and I are rooting hard for Team USA as the Special Olympics World Games get underway this week. Our Special Olympians are terrific examples of America‚Äôs heart and drive. 
What a great moment. Happy 110th, Virginia. 
Michelle and I send our deepest sympathies to all who knew the victims of today‚Äôs plane crash in Ethiopia. 
The Crew Dragon‚Äôs been on quite a ride since I last saw it‚Äîcongrats to @NASA and @SpaceX on a successful return! We invested in the @Commercial_Crew program to strengthen the U.S. space program for the long haul, and it‚Äôs great to see that happening. 
Preethi, Alice, and Sefora are just three of many @ObamaFoundation leaders who remind us what International Women‚Äôs Day is all about: imagining a world free of artificial ceilings for the next generation‚Äîand doing the hard work to get us there. 
And @SeforaKodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in Africa rise up. Her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. 
.@BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay. More importantly, she‚Äôs fighting a narrative that suggests our differences are more important than our shared humanity. 
.@preethiherman is helping women unleash their power to change their societies. As head of the Foundation, she‚Äôs leading an initiative that combines online tools with in-person organizing, giving women a voice in her native India‚Äîand beyond. 
On International Women‚Äôs Day, I‚Äôm reflecting on the future we all want for our daughters: one where they can live out their aspirations without limits. And I‚Äôm celebrating some of the women who are building that future for all of us today. 
It‚Äôs up to all of us as citizens to make sure that the rules of democracy are fair‚Äîeverywhere‚Äîbecause the next decade of our nation's progress is on the line. Join me and @allontheline in the fight against gerrymandering: 
Zion Williamson seems like an outstanding young man as well as an outstanding basketball player. Wishing him a speedy recovery. 
I‚Äôm about to join @StephenCurry30 on stage with @MBK_Alliance to answer questions from boys and young men of color about the challenges that confront them and the opportunities within their grasp. Tune in at 
Ahead of #MBKRising and in honor of Black History Month, @BarackObama shared a nonfiction reading list that can help to provide some essential context about the challenges that many people of color face every day. Take a look, then tune in tomorrow: 
I‚Äôve always loved basketball because it‚Äôs about building a team that‚Äôs equal to more than the sum of its parts. Glad to see this expansion into Africa because for a rising continent, this can be about a lot more than what happens on the court. 
Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day to the extraordinarily smart, beautiful, funny, one and only @MichelleObama. It‚Äôs true; she does get down to Motown. 
In the year since their friends were killed, the students of Parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country. I'm proud of all of them. 
Don‚Äôt be sad it‚Äôs over, be proud it taught us so much. Congrats to all the men and women of @NASA on a @MarsRovers mission that beat all expectations, inspired a new generation of Americans, and demands we keep investing in science that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge. 
Happy 85th birthday to @RealBillRussell - the greatest champion in American sports, and a lifelong warrior for justice. 
A big part of friendship is showing up for your girls‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I was thrilled to be there for the one and only @aliciakeys at the #GRAMMYs. She is one of the most genuine and thoughtful people I know‚Äîthere‚Äôs no one better to help us all celebrate the unifying power of music! 
My statement on the passing of former Congressman John Dingell: 
We lost two great Americans today ‚Äì Frank Robinson and John Dingell ‚Äì citizens who inspired me and so many others by leading on the civil rights issues of our time, opening doors to others, and leaving it all on the field. 
As we celebrate Black History Month and Jackie Robinson‚Äôs 100th birthday, we celebrate the life of all whose courage opened the gates for everybody, and in the process, made America better. 
The @ObamaFoundation is connecting people from around the world so they can form partnerships just like this. I am inspired by Robert and Vanessa and what‚Äôs possible when leaders come together to have an even greater impact on the world. 
I‚Äôve always drawn inspiration from what Dr. King called life‚Äôs most persistent and urgent question: "What are you doing for others?" Let‚Äôs honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world. 
President Obama challenged us to improve our communities in 2019‚Äîand mentorship is a concrete action we can take. With @MENTORnational, we‚Äôre expanding mentoring across the U.S. On #InternationalMentoringDay help a young person reach their full potential: 
I knew it way back then and I‚Äôm absolutely convinced of it today ‚Äî you‚Äôre one of a kind, @MichelleObama. Happy Birthday! 
In 2018 people stepped up and showed up like never before. Keep it up in 2019. We‚Äôve got a lot of work to do, and I‚Äôll be right there with you. Happy New Year, everybody! 
I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn‚Äôt the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it. 
Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. 
Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica. 
Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. 
Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. 
As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I‚Äôm asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year. 
As 2018 draws to a close, I‚Äôm continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: 
Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas! 
There‚Äôs no better time than the holidays to give back to your community. Yesterday I got to do just that at @ChildrensHealth. As we celebrate the season and look forward to 2019, let‚Äôs recommit to doing our part to build a world that is a little more generous, tolerant, and kind. 
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to the extraordinary kids, families, and staff at Children‚Äôs National. And thanks for humoring me as your stand-in Santa. 
Today is the last day of open enrollment. That means it‚Äôs the deadline to make sure you and the people you love have health insurance in 2019. So head over to to get covered! Here‚Äôs what else you need to know today about health care: 
Joe is right. Head to before tomorrow‚Äôs deadline. And nice bracelet, by the way. 
As Bobby Kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. And if we do our best with the time we‚Äôre given, others will take hope in our example. 
The Cares Family reaches across generational divides to reduce loneliness in the U.K. Hear more from Alex Smith, founder and one of our #ObamaFellows: 
No jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time. I‚Äôm going to give it to you straight: If you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is December 15. Go to today and pass this on ‚Äî you just might save a life. 
Just ONE WEEK LEFT to #GetCovered for 2019. Most folks can find coverage for $75 or less per month. Head over to today and sign up for a plan that‚Äôs right for you and your family. 
Happy Hanukkah! Over these eight nights, we draw inspiration from light that can overpower any darkness, and recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for our families, our communities, and our world. Chag Sameach from the Obama family to yours. 
America has lost a patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush. While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight ‚Äì and all who were inspired by George and Barbara‚Äôs example. 
I am grateful for the next generation of leaders -- the young people who are tolerant, creative, idealistic and doing the work to create the world as it should be. Who understand that hope requires action. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. 
Thanks to the Chicago @FoodDepository team for all you do and to the volunteers who are doing great work and let me crash today. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! 
The Obama Presidential Center represents a historic opportunity to build a world-class museum and public gathering space on Chicago‚Äôs South Side. Take a look at the future campus: 
When someone shares their story, we see the world through their eyes. I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing a few from leaders around the world and sharing my own at the @ObamaFoundation Summit in Chicago. Tune in at 
Our future depends on all our young people, including our boys and young men of color, being able to achieve their dreams. Today, I‚Äôm proud to share @MBK_Alliance‚Äôs first investments in communities devoted to this mission. Get inspired: 
Of course, @MichelleObama‚Äôs my wife, so I‚Äôm a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise ‚Äì one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. 
Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who‚Äôs lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who‚Äôve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: 
To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend. 
Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won‚Äôt come from one election alone ‚Äì but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. 
Today is the day. Today, it‚Äôs your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better. So make it count. Get out there and vote. Go to or call 833-336-VOTE to confirm where you can vote and check voting hours.

When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment ‚Äì and make sure they‚Äôre paid equally. 
When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen. 
Tomorrow‚Äôs elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot. 
Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. 
Elections matter. You have the power to protect a family‚Äôs health care. Make a plan, grab some friends, and vote: 
While we're talking about preexisting conditions, the ACA is the law that finally protected your coverage for preexisting conditions. Those protections and your health care are absolutely at stake on Tuesday. Vote for Democrats who‚Äôll protect them. 
Not sure who and what you can vote for? Head over to to look up your state, learn who's running to represent you, which measures you can help decide, and more. Read up, and get ready to vote on November 6. 
Your vote can decide the health care of millions. Your voice can determine the character of our country. You have power ‚Äî use it! In most states, you don't even have to wait until Election Day to cast a ballot. Find out where you can vote before Nov. 6: 
We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun. 
The last presidential election turned on fewer than 100,000 votes in three states. More people go to Coachella. There‚Äôs no good excuse not to vote. Head over to to check your registration, get your absentee ballot, and find out where to vote on November 6. 
America is always at our best when we look out for each other. Please do what you can to help people recover and rebuild from Hurricane Michael. 
I‚Äôm so proud of the work @MichelleObama has done over the years to ensure adolescent girls have access to education, and I know that the @GirlsAlliance will be another great chapter in her effort to get girls the opportunities they deserve. 
Congratulations to Drew Brees on the all time passing record. Always a class act. 
Happy Anniversary, @MichelleObama. For 26 years, you‚Äôve been an extraordinary partner, someone who can always make me laugh, and my favorite person to see the world with. 
Today, I‚Äôm proud to endorse even more Democratic candidates who aren‚Äôt just running against something, but for something‚Äîto expand opportunity for all of us and to restore dignity, honor, and compassion to public service. They deserve your vote: 
From civil servants to organizers, the young people I met in Amsterdam today are doing the hard work of change. And they keep at it for their communities, their countries, and the collective future of Europe and the world. Keep up the good work. 
The antidote to government by a powerful few is government by the organized, energized many. This National Voter Registration Day, make sure you're registered, vote early if you can, or show up on November 6. This moment is too important to sit out. 
The first class of Obama Fellows is full of leaders like Keith‚Äîhardworking, innovative, and dedicated to partnering with their communities to drive transformational change. 
We will always remember everyone we lost on 9/11, thank the first responders who keep us safe, and honor all who defend our country and the ideals that bind us together. There's nothing our resilience and resolve can‚Äôt overcome, and no act of terror can ever change who we are. 
If you still don't think the midterms will affect you, @BarackObama is back to spell out just how important they are 
Today I‚Äôm at the University of Illinois to deliver a simple message to young people all over the country: You need to vote, because our democracy depends on it. I hope you'll tune in at 11am CT: 
Yesterday I met with high school students on Chicago‚Äôs Southwest side who spent the summer learning to code some pretty cool apps. Michelle and I are proud to support programs that invest in local youth and we‚Äôre proud of these young people. 
Congratulations to Hawaii for winning the Little League World Series! You make America very proud. ü§ô 
Our statement on the passing of Senator John McCain: 
Aretha helped define the American experience. In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade‚Äîour power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect. May the Queen of Soul rest in eternal peace. 
Bobby Kennedy was one of my heroes. He was someone who showed us the power of acting on our ideals, the idea that any of us can be one of the ‚Äúmillion different centers of energy and daring‚Äù that ultimately combine to change the world for the better. 
I‚Äôm confident that, together, they‚Äôll strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility, and the rule of law. But first, they need our votes. 
Today I‚Äôm proud to endorse such a wide and impressive array of Democratic candidates ‚Äì leaders as diverse, patriotic, and big-hearted as the America they‚Äôre running to represent: 
Mandela Day is about taking action to change the world for the better. In these young people, I see Madiba's example of persistence and hope. They are poised to make this world more peaceful, more prosperous, and more just. 
This week, I‚Äôm traveling to Africa for the first time since I left office ‚Äì a continent of wonderful diversity, thriving culture, and remarkable stories. As I prepare for this trip, I wanted to share a list of books that I‚Äôd recommend for summer reading: 
Sometimes truth transcends party. 
Congratulations to the @Capitals! This @NHLBlackhawks fan knows what it‚Äôs like to lift that cup ‚Äì and I‚Äôm happy for all the Caps fans who cheer so hard for their team, and for a team that celebrates so hard with its fans. 
‚ÄúLow plastic stool, cheap but delicious noodles, cold Hanoi beer.‚Äù This is how I‚Äôll remember Tony. He taught us about food ‚Äî but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We‚Äôll miss him. 
This National Gun Violence Awareness Day, show your commitment to keeping our kids safe from gun violence. Then, for everyone we‚Äôve lost, take action to change our leadership and our laws until they reflect that commitment - no matter how long it takes. 
We can never truly repay the debt we owe our fallen heroes. But we can remember them, honor their sacrifice, and affirm in our own lives those enduring ideals of justice, equality, and opportunity for which generations of Americans have given that last full measure of devotion. 
This Center is for the leaders of tomorrow who are ready to step up and build the world as it should be. Michelle and I are grateful to Chicagoans and the Chicago City Council for making it happen. 
Happy Mother‚Äôs Day to every mom out there, especially the remarkable moms in my life, @MichelleObama and my mother-in-law, Marian Robinson. 
There are few issues more important to the security of the US than the potential spread of nuclear weapons or the potential for even more destructive war in the Middle East. Today‚Äôs decision to put the JCPOA at risk is a serious mistake. My full statement: 
Happy #CollegeSigningDay! So excited to be in Philly to celebrate all the young people making the commitment to higher education. 
These talented young people will create a better future not just in Africa, but around the world. I can‚Äôt wait to spend some time with @ObamaFoundation Leaders and look forward to honoring the Mandela legacy in Johannesburg this summer. 
Our statement on the passing of Former First Lady Barbara Bush: 
We just announced the inaugural class of #ObamaFellows. These 20 civic leaders have carried out inspiring work around the world. Now, they‚Äôll come together to collaborate, exchange ideas, and inspire a wave of civic innovation. Meet the Fellows: 
This week‚Äî50 years since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was killed‚Äî@BarackObama and @RepJohnLewis sat down with a group of young men for an @MBK_Alliance roundtable to talk about Dr. King's legacy and the courage it takes to stand up for what you believe in: 
Incredible to have a Chicago team in the Final Four. I‚Äôll take that over an intact bracket any day! Congratulations to everybody @LoyolaChicago - let‚Äôs keep it going! 
Michelle and I are so inspired by all the young people who made today‚Äôs marches happen. Keep at it. You‚Äôre leading us forward. Nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change. 
Our most important task as a nation is to make sure all our young people can achieve their dreams. We‚Äôve started this work with @MBK_Alliance, but there‚Äôs so much more all of us have to do‚Äîgovernment, private sector, academia community leaders‚Äîto change the odds for our kids. 
In Singapore with young people who are advocating for education, empowering young women, and getting involved all over Southeast Asia with a profoundly optimistic commitment to building the world they want to see. 
41: I like the competition. And the loyalty to the home team. - 44 
Congrats to @LoyolaChicago and Sister Jean for a last-second upset - I had faith in my pick! 
Just because I have more time to watch games doesn‚Äôt mean my picks will be better, but here are my brackets this year: 
Have fun out there among the stars. 
Four years ago, @MichelleObama and I had the privilege to host Lt. Cmdr. Dan Cnossen and his fellow Paralympians and Olympians at the White House. Today, we‚Äôre so proud of him for winning gold and silver - while still representing the red, white, and blue. 
I got my start holding community meetings in Chicago, so it was fun to be home for one tonight. Michelle and I want the world to come together on the South Side at a place built with local ideas, values, and hopes. That‚Äôs the @ObamaFoundation and Presidential Center. 
Young people have helped lead all our great movements. How inspiring to see it again in so many smart, fearless students standing up for their right to be safe; marching and organizing to remake the world as it should be. We've been waiting for you. And we've got your backs. 
Billy Graham was a humble servant who prayed for so many - and who, with wisdom and grace, gave hope and guidance to generations of Americans. 
We are grieving with Parkland. But we are not powerless. Caring for our kids is our first job. And until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want, then we have to change. 
Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day, @MichelleObama. You make every day and every place better. 
Happy #ValentinesDay to my one and only, @BarackObama. To celebrate the occasion, I‚Äôm dedicating a little Valentine‚Äôs Day playlist to you! 
Dr. King was 26 when the Montgomery bus boycott began. He started small, rallying others who believed their efforts mattered, pressing on through challenges and doubts to change our world for the better. A permanent inspiration for the rest of us to keep pushing towards justice. 
All across America people chose to get involved, get engaged and stand up. Each of us can make a difference, and all of us ought to try. So go keep changing the world in 2018. 
Ten-year-old Jahkil Jackson is on a mission to help homeless people in Chicago. He created kits full of socks, toiletries, and food for those in need. Just this week, Jahkil reached his goal to give away 5,000 ‚Äúblessing bags.‚Äù That‚Äôs a story from 2017. 
Chris Long gave his paychecks from the first six games of the NFL season to fund scholarships in Charlottesville, VA. He wanted to do more, so he decided to give away an entire season‚Äôs salary. That‚Äôs a story from 2017. 
Kat Creech, a wedding planner in Houston, turned a postponed wedding into a volunteer opportunity for Hurricane Harvey victims. Thirty wedding guests became an organization of hundreds of volunteers. That‚Äôs a story from 2017. 
As we count down to the new year, we get to reflect and prepare for what‚Äôs ahead. For all the bad news that seemed to dominate our collective consciousness, there are countless stories from this year that remind us what's best about America. 
I am my Brother‚Äôs Keeper. Watch our new PSA with @BarackObama, @StephenCurry30 @chancetherapper, then take action to stand with young men of color at 
On behalf of the Obama family, Merry Christmas! We wish you joy and peace this holiday season.

Today, we honor those who have honored our country with its highest form of service. 
This is what happens when the people vote. Congrats @RalphNortham and @PhilMurphyNJ . And congratulations to all the victors in state legislative, county and mayors' races. Every office in a democracy counts! 
Every election matters - those who show up determine our future. Go vote tomorrow! 
May God also grant all of us the wisdom to ask what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst. 
We grieve with all the families in Sutherland Springs harmed by this act of hatred, and we‚Äôll stand with the survivors as they recover... 
Starting today, you can sign up for 2018 health coverage. Head on over to and find a plan that meets your needs.

Instead of investing in Americans and their families, the Trump budget would: 1. Add $33 billion to the Defense budget for a total of $718 billion. Even without those additions, our defense budget is equal to the military spending of half the world. 
The budget would cut or remove the following over the next decade: - $845 billion from Medicare - $241 billion from Medicaid - $220 billion from the SNAP nutrition program for low-income families - $207 billion from federal student loan programs 
An administration's budget says a lot about what‚Äîand, more importantly, who‚Äîit values. So let's talk about the Trump administration's 2020 budget proposal and why it makes clear that this administration doesn‚Äôt value seniors, low-income families, and young people.

For #InternationalWomensDay, I'm issuing you a challenge. We know that when women run for office, they're elected at the same rate as men. But not as many women run as men‚Äîoften because people don't ask women to run as often as they ask men. 
In other words: Women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights. Period. Call your members of Congress today and ask them to support the Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights Act: (202) 224-3121 #ReproRightsAreHumanRights 
By requiring annual reporting on women's access to basic health care like contraception, safe abortion, and maternal health care around the world, Congress can make sure the rights of women and girls will no longer be up for grabs in each election. 
Women's reproductive rights are human rights that are universal and indivisible. Governments do not get to pick and choose whose rights and which rights will be respected. 
I introduced reproductive rights sections to the reports while I was secretary of state because access to reproductive health care is a protected human right affecting women's right to life, equality, and freedom from inhumane treatment. 
Her U.S. asylum officer opens up the State Department's human rights reports and finds no information about those 17 women imprisoned for miscarrying or El Salvador's abortion ban. He deems she has no credible fear of persecution if she returns home. He denies her application. 
Imagine how this can play out. A woman living in El Salvador, where abortion is banned, is raped and becomes pregnant. She suffers a miscarriage and decides to flee the country knowing that 17 of her countrywomen were sentenced to up to 40 years in prison after miscarrying. 
Of particular note: U.S. immigration judges and asylum officers use the human rights reports to evaluate the credibility of an applicant's fear of persecution. Human rights reports that contradict an asylum seeker in virtually any way can be fatal to an asylum application. 
Human rights advocates, lawmakers, academics, businesses, NGOs, and other institutions all over the world use the reports to inform their work as well. 
Some background: All branches of the U.S. government use the State Department's human rights reports to shape policy and inform decision-making around diplomacy and allocations of aid and security. 
Important legislation introduced yesterday: The Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights Act would correct the Trump administration's dangerous decision to remove reporting on reproductive rights from the State Department's annual reports on human rights practices around the world.

Quite a scene in Selma today on the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. 
I was so honored to be invited to participate in the #SelmaJubilee this weekend. We're living through a full-fledged crisis in our democracy. But history teaches us that when the struggle feels the hardest is when marching forward is most important. 
Hillary Clinton speaks at Selma Anniversary breakfast: "We aren't going to win every fight -- take that from me. But history does teach us that the times when the struggle feels the hardest are the times when marching forward is the most important." 
Back in Selma, Alabama this morning to kick off the #SelmaJubilee. Lots of events throughout the day. Tune into the Unity Breakfast where I‚Äôll talk about the fight for voting rights how it must be central to a 21st century civil rights movement. 
A second call you can make right now to help families who want to reunite with their kids: Call your member of Congress and ask them to put pressure on CBP to grant asylum to parents applying in Mexicali today. The Capitol switchboard number is 202-224-3121.

A year and a half after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, HUD finally approved a new recovery plan with $8.2B in additional funding. We won't stop holding this administration accountable pushing for recovery efforts to remain a national priority.

We have many fights ahead‚Äîfrom reuniting separated families to making sure the workers who care for families and homes across the country are treated with dignity and respect. I hope you‚Äôll take a moment to learn more about NDWA and their mission: 
I met with @aijenpoo and @aliciagarza to talk about ways we could continue working together, and a partnership was born. 
Since last summer, @OnwardTogether has raised more than $1.8 million for the groups working to protect the kids and families separated by ICE, including Families Belong Together, NDWA's initiative to fight the Trump administration's family separation policy. 
The National @DomesticWorkers Alliance has worked to protect domestic workers, immigrants, women, and their families for more than a decade, and I'm proud to say that NDWA has joined @OnwardTogether as an official partner. 
‚ÄúImmigrants and women move humanity forward.‚Äù Well said, @chefjoseandres. #Oscars 
The heartbreaking violence in Venezuela must stop. I stand with President @JGuaido, the National Assembly, and the people of #Venezuela as they embrace their right to live in peace, choose their leaders, and decide their future, in harmony with their neighbors. 
I urge Nicol√°s Maduro to allow humanitarian aid inside Venezuela‚Äôs borders peacefully. People are in need of life-saving medicines, children are subsisting on one meal a day, and a peaceful delivery of food and supplies is to the benefit of all. 
The administration just put a gag rule in place that bars Title X health care providers from referring patients for safe and legal abortions. It's an attack on Planned Parenthood and 1.6 million patients who may not be able to afford care anywhere else. #IStandWithPP #NoGagRule 
Insects are declining worldwide because of pesticide use. This is nuts. We need bees! 
Congratulations to @IamMinyon and her co-authors on the @NAACP Image Award nominations of ‚ÄúFor Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics." It's a wonderful, necessary book. 
A new report from the @TXCivilRights Project has found shocking proof that the Trump administration lied about ending its inhumane policy of separating families at the border. Hundreds more separations have occurred. This is outrageous. 
Today, we‚Äôre excited to partner with @letamericavote on the creation of the Local Election Authority Initiative! Learn more about our project and sign up to run:

Based on my work, this is a good example for us to consider. The goal has to be quality, affordable universal health care for everyone.

An excellent Q&amp;A with @DrLeanaWen of Planned Parenthood touching on the crisis of rising maternal mortality rates in America and why the fight to save reproductive choice is more pressing than ever. I admit to being partial to the interviewer. 
In light of clear evidence that Russia has interfered with our elections in the past and seeks to do so again, it's inexcusable that the administration is downsizing DHS task forces charged with protecting our elections from foreign influence. 
.@Politico reports today: "A wide-ranging disinformation campaign aimed at Democratic 2020 candidates is already underway on social media, with signs that foreign state actors are driving at least some of the activity." 
The real national emergencies: - Relentless gun violence. - Children separated from their families at the border. - Climate change. - Americans dying for lack of health care. 
Trump just declared a #FAKENationalEmergency at the border. Trump is going around Congress, the will of the people, abusing the powers of the presidency to build his hateful wall. There‚Äôs no time to waste - it‚Äôs time to mobilize to defend our democracy. Here‚Äôs what you can do: 
Democracy should mean free and fair access to the ballot box. But in America, voting rights are under attack. I‚Äôm honored to have been invited to join the 54th Bridge Crossing Jubilee in Selma, Alabama on March 3rd to march for voting rights with @liftourvote. #liftourvote2020 
Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that @realDonaldTrump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall. 
Parkland survivor @DavidHogg111's goal for 2020 is to encourage more young people to vote. His goal is 71% youth turnout, up from 50% in 2016. Help reach that goal today by sharing this registration link far and wide: 
Join a cause today, support a gun-sense candidate, or find another way to pitch in. We can save lives, honor victims, and give too many grieving communities the knowledge that "Never again" means "Never again." 
Just yesterday, the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance a measure that would require background checks for all gun sales and most gun transfers. Rep. @LucyMcBath, who lost a child to gun violence, cast her vote by saying: "For my son Jordan Davis, I vote aye." 
We must remember and reaffirm that gun violence is not an intractable problem. We will not accept it. We know what to do to solve it. @MomsDemand, @Everytown, @AMarch4OurLives, and so many others are making progress every day. 
A year ago today, 17 families lost loved ones to gun violence that should never have happened. A community lost friends, teammates, and beloved coaches. Let's remember their stories today, as told by student journalists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High. 
.@IndivisibleTeam is rallying support this week for the #PaycheckFairnessAct. Call your member of Congress and tell them you want this chart to change. 
@karaswisher @jack @voxmediainc Kara, here's a listening-face GIF if you need one.

Now copy my plan on health care, a fairer tax system, and voting rights. 
Only about 1% of abortions happen later in pregnancy‚Äîalmost always because a woman‚Äôs health or life is at risk, or the pregnancy is no longer viable. Lying about this is dangerous, and a slap in the face to families who face heartbreaking situations.

Can‚Äôt wait to meet you, Bonnie! And thanks so much to everyone who entered my @omaze campaign in support of @OnwardTogether. 
This was such a joy. And it's true, we need young people more than ever in public service. There‚Äôs a lot of hard work that has to be done, but there‚Äôs also a lot of room for imagination.

About to talk with my friend Ambassador Bill Burns at @georgetownsfs @GUPolitics about the future of diplomacy. Livestream here: 
When I met @MeehanBM she was a bright young foreign service officer. Now she‚Äôs leading a panel of fellow senior diplomats to kick off our ‚ÄúFuture of Diplomacy‚Äù symposium today at ‚Å¶@georgetownsfs‚Å©. What a pleasure to hear from all of you. More to come! 
So delighted to be at @georgetownsfs today for a de facto State Department reunion with old colleagues and friends, 10 years since I took office as secretary of state. 
SPONSORED: ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs rights are human rights." @HillaryClinton explains the story behind her famous line on a new episode of the @GIWPS podcast #SeekingPeace. Listen here: 
"America is made stronger by the presence of immigrants, not walls." ‚Äî@StaceyAbrams 
I'll be at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service today for a symposium on the future of diplomacy‚Äîand to wish @georgetownsfs a happy 100 year anniversary! My conversation with Ambassador Bill Burns will be livestreamed here at 4:30pm ET: 
There are 85,000 positions up for election in 2019, mostly at the municipal level. Learn more @runforsomething 
What a wonderful sight this is. 
American women today are 50% more likely to die in childbirth than their own mothers. Let's not mince words. The loss of reproductive freedom means more dead women. 
Having cruelly separated children from their parents, the Trump administration now claims it would require "extraordinary effort" to reunite families. Children are being harmed every day. Unreal and inhumane. I'm thankful the @ACLU is back in court Feb 21. 
This has gone on too long. There is nothing to debate. He must resign. 
Happy #BlackHistoryMonth! Black women made history up and down the ballot and we celebrate their accomplishments this month and every day. #BHM #EmergeNow #BlackWomenLead 
College students: Your generation broke turnout records in the 2018 midterms. We need your voices more than ever! Make them LOUD‚Äîapply to the Swing Left College Fellowship:

Looking forward to the second day of @ClintonFdn's San Juan event on post-disaster recovery in the Caribbean. Hope you'll tune in this morning as Hillary hosts a discussion on empowering youth in the region to build back better: #IdeasIntoAction 
On top of human suffering and lasting damage to our national parks, the Trump shutdown cost the economy $11 billion. End shutdowns as a political hostage-taking tactic. 
Hurricane Maria decimated trees and ecosystems in Puerto Rico. Para La Naturaleza's nurseries have made a CGI commitment to plant 750,000 trees in seven years. The team here has already grown 120,000 seedlings and planted 30,000 trees. 
Time to make the churros at Kreamy Ice Cream Shop in Puerto Rico. @ClintonGlobal and @Foundation_PR are working together to deploy $1.2 million in grants to local entrepreneurs as small businesses continue to recover from Hurricane Maria. 
@chefjoseandres You are an inspiration, my friend. 
Through a grant from Jos√©, Franco and Natalia Medina were able to invest in a USDA-grade cleaning station, freezer, and storage unit for their farm. Now they can expand to selling produce to restaurants and grocery stores. 
Having an amazing day touring @ClintonGlobal sites in Puerto Rico. Started the day with @chefjoseandres at a Plow to Plate farm, one of many made possible through Jos√©'s energy ingenuity and a CGI commitment. 
President Trump has abandoned Puerto Rico time and time again. Now he‚Äôs robbing them ‚Äî American citizens ‚Äî of money earmarked for recovery efforts in order to pay for his 2,000-mile monument to xenophobia. Don't let him get away with it. 
Two years ago this week, the president signed an executive order banning travelers from Muslim-majority countries. The consequences have been tragic, for families and for our country. Congress should hold the administration to account. 
We are grateful for the assistance provided by @BillClinton and @HillaryClinton through the @ClintonFdn. @Mercader1 
NEW: Members of the @ClintonGlobal community airlifted 30K lbs of requested medical supplies to San Juan, Puerto Rico today. More:

The government shutdown is by far the longest in U.S. history. It's put hundreds of thousands of people under financial stress and endangered our security. Join a National Call In Day to end it. @IndivisibleTeam has scripts and numbers for senators here: 
Forty-six years after Roe v. Wade, we reaffirm what will always be true: Women have an unalienable right to make their own decisions about their health care. 
Nine years since Citizens United, the amount of money in politics hasn't changed dramatically. But who funds politics has: "a handful of donors who make multimillion dollar contributions." The result: disastrous laws like Trump's tax giveaway to the rich. 
It's a good day to make some #goodtrouble. 
@carlreiner Whatever it takes to keep you with us Carl. I‚Äôm holding you to it. 
‚ÄúThe Trump administration likely separated thousands more children from their parents at the Southern border than was previously believed.‚Äù This is an outrage! We need hearings, answers, and solutions immediately. 
Don't throw away your shot: Support the progressive work of @OnwardTogether and join me for a Broadway play in New York, flights and hotel on us! Enter here: 
Thank you, Mary Oliver, for giving so many of us words to live by. "Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?" 
The Senate could override the presidential veto and end the #TrumpShutdown today. That's how checks and balances work, Mitch McConnell. #EndTheShutdown 
Endorsement Alert We‚Äôre starting off 2019 with a bang! Get to know our 21 newly endorsed candidates today! 
If the government shutdown lasts beyond tomorrow, domestic violence shelters that rely on federal funding will be forced to begin shutting their doors and closing down hotlines. In so many ways, lives are on the line. 
The #TrumpShutdown is bad for our country and bad for the economy. Mitch McConnell is refusing to vote on ending the shutdown in the Senate. Call your Senator tell them to act: 
Measles cases surged 30% last year. Grateful @WHO calling out unfounded, unscientific ‚Äúvaccine hesitancy‚Äù alongside climate change air pollution, NCDs, a possible global #flu pandemic, antimicrobial resistance, weak primary care, Ebola, Dengue, HIV as top health risks for 2019. 
Yesterday, the New York state legislature voted to pass new bills allowing early voting, pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds, and consolidated state and federal primaries. They're great first steps to fixing our democracy. Congratulations to all, and let's keep going! 
@KLSecondCity Please pass on to Nora that I'm thinking of her, rooting for her, and a proud member of #TeamNora. 
The impacts of the #TrumpShutdown are shameful. Here‚Äôs how to tell your Senator to end this and restore funding to programs that need it: 
Today's the deadline to apply for a spot in a campaign training program run by @arenasummit, an @onwardtogether partner. If you're an aspiring organizer, campaign staffer, or candidate, you can't ask for a better opportunity to learn the ropes. 
Like I said: A puppet. 
Americans can't afford another day. Call your senator and demand a vote to re-open: (202) 224-3121 And make sure your friends and family in Kentucky call @senatemajldr: Louisville: (502) 582-6304 Lexington: (859) 224-8286 Bowling Green: (270) 781-1673 Washington: (202) 224-2541 
As of today, this shutdown is the longest in history. The costs are already high: People are missing paychecks, losing business, or working without pay. Our national parks are overrun with trash. The FDA and FBI warn of the harm to our food safety and national security. 
I‚Äôll join you for game night any time @HillaryClinton ! Watch our #BroadwayOrBeltway video and support the incredible work of @OnwardTogether. 
Thanks to @tonygoldwyn for helping me get the word out: There's still time to join me for a Broadway show in New York City to support the work of @OnwardTogether. Enter for your chance to win: 
Update: She won! Congrats to Senator-elect @JenniferBoysko, the first Democratic victory of 2019 in Virginia‚Äîand not the last by any stretch. 
We've raised over $100k and counting for organizations that help families and kids at the border since the beginning of the president's TV stunt last night. Let's keep counteracting his lies about migrants and refugees with positive action: 
Want to fight back against Trump's ridiculous address tonight? Send some support to organizations that help kids at the border. The only border crisis we're facing is the inhumane detention of kids that has already led to the deaths of two children. 
Know someone in Northern Virginia, specifically Fairfax or Loudoun County? They may have the chance to vote for @JenniferBoysko today in Senate District 33's special election. Spread the word‚Äîvoting info here: #KeepSD33 
A week ago, 200,000 previously uninsured Virginians got access to health care through Medicaid expansion thanks to votes from @KathyKLTran, @PWCDanica, @JCarrollFoy, @DelegateFowler, and other 2017 state leg winners. Elections have consequences, and sometimes they're great ones. 
At this moment, somewhere in the world, young girls and women who look like us are learning to believe that they too can change the world and that no dream is too big. Representation matters. @AyannaPressley 
Our democracy is broken. House Democrats' first bill, #HR1, would help fix it. Call your representative now and ask them to support automatic voter registration, restoring the Voting Rights Act, and lessening the influence of big money in politics: 
Today we are sending a strong message that we stand united in the fight to protect women‚Äôs rights. We must codify Roe v. Wade into state law and we must do it now. #RHAin30Days 
I‚Äôll be joining @NYGovCuomo as he lays out his plan to codify Roe v. Wade and pass the Reproductive Health Act. There‚Äôs no time to wait. #RHAin30Days 
To the women sworn in to Congress today, the most in our history: Congratulations. Knock it out of the park. 
I'm grateful to everyone who brought light into 2018: organizers, journalists, candidates, marchers, activists, and voters. Here's to you. Happy New Year. 
Merry Christmas to everyone celebrating today! 
As we finalize our plans for 2019 and beyond, I'm feeling grateful and proud to work alongside these smart, passionate partners. As ever, you can learn more about our work and help support it at Onward to 2019. 
There was a 10-point increase in youth turnout from 2014 to 2018, due in part to the hard work done by @Alliance4Youth. More than 30% of young people voted in 2018! In Chicago, young people outperformed all other generations on Election Day for the first time ever. 
Five @EmergeAmerica alumni are headed to Congress, and 145 were elected to state legislatures. Emerge alums also helped put an end to the Republican supermajorities in the Michigan and Pennsylvania senates. 
For many campaigns, @SwingLeft was the wave. On average, for their top 15 campaigns, Swing Left drove more than 50% of their canvassing shifts. More than 60,000 volunteers knocked an estimated 5 million doors and made 2.5 million phone calls. 
In 2018, @LatinoVictoryUS increased their endorsed candidates 500% over the previous year. Of their 58 candidates, 43 candidates won, bringing their 2018 win rate to a whopping 74%. The number of Democratic Latina members of Congress nearly doubled. 
In two years, @RunforSomething has recruited 28,000 young, diverse progressives who want to run for office and elected more than 200 of them to local office in 40 states. In 2018, their candidates were 3 of the 12 Texas House pick-ups and 3 of the 11 Florida House pick-ups. 
.@ArenaSummit supported 54 candidates in the 2018 election cycle, and 27 of their candidates on the ballot won their elections. Their 2018 New York candidates went 7 for 9‚Äîensuring Democrats defeated the IDC, took back the N.Y. State Senate, and won a majority in the U.S. House. 
.@VotoLatino registered thousands of voters through online digital ads and targeting, peer-to-peer outreach through their local chapters, and national partner engagement. In Texas, where Voto Latino has had a program since 2010, early votes surpassed 2014 totals by 149%. 
.@ColorOfChange PAC‚Äôs #VotingWhileBlack program reached more than 5 million voters, and now African Americans have a new cohort of officeholders at both the local and state level. 
Three candidates that @iVoteFund supported for Secretary of State won‚Äîall pick-ups, all young women, all Democrats. And they were able to raise and invest $7 million in Secretary of State races, their most ever. 
.@CollectivePAC helped elect over 54 African Americans to local, state and federal offices, trained over 300 operatives and staff through the Black Campaign School, and engaged over 1.5 million black voters. 
Nine @IndivisibleTeam-endorsed candidates won. Overall, the margin in their endorsed races swung 8 points to the left. Among races rated ‚ÄúSolid R," that swing was 15 points. 
This year, @OnwardTogether was able to give more than $2.5 million in funding and grants to organizations fighting to make our country a better place. I'm deeply inspired by what our partners have achieved this year. I think you will be too, so here's a report-back: 
Actions have consequences, and whether we‚Äôre in Syria or not, the people who want to harm us are there at war. Isolationism is weakness. Empowering ISIS is dangerous. Playing into Russia Iran‚Äôs hands is foolish. This President is putting our national security at grave risk. 
Winning back the House was a pipe dream a year ago. @IndivisibleTeam, an @OnwardTogether partner, helped win 40 seats. Now they're going on offense in the House and building power in the states. Read their roadmap for the next two years: 
.@ArenaSummit, an @OnwardTogether partner, is offering a new Arena Academy program to help aspiring organizers and campaign staffers get the skills they need. The early decision deadline for February's session is this Friday: 
This is a game changer. 70% of incoming Congressional Dems have never held public office, coming in with fresh eyes and fresh ideas. 
Nevada just became the first state in the country to have a legislature that's majority women. Let's make it the first of many. 
Spread the word: Some states have extended Affordable Care Act enrollment into January. Full list here:

We should all bear witness to the humanitarian crisis at our border and continue to work to stop it. "Thousands of children are living in a tent prison. In the desert. For months on end." 
A Russian disinformation campaign ‚Äúused every major social media platform to deliver words, images and videos tailored to voters‚Äô interests to help elect President Trump‚Äîand worked even harder to support him while in office." 
There‚Äôs new CDC data out about gun deaths in America. Last year saw the most gun deaths in 40 years, nearly 40,000 people. What is wrong with us? This is not a problem we should have at all, let alone one that‚Äôs getting worse. 
The theater adaptation of Network, @NetworkBway, makes Paddy Chayefsky's story about the blurring of news and entertainment feel more relevant than ever. @BryanCranston, @TonyGoldwyn, and @TatianaMaslany are wonderful in it. Go see it at the Belasco Theatre if you can.

One of my personal heroes is Ela Bhatt, who has provided microloans to women in India for 46 years. Her work embodies the principle that every person should have the chance to achieve his or her dreams and make the most of their God-given potential. 
No child should have to fear violence in their school. It should have been true for Sandy Hook six years ago. It should be true today. Let's keep working until it's reality. 
There are no words to capture the horror of a seven-year-old girl dying of dehydration in U.S. custody. What‚Äôs happening at our borders is a humanitarian crisis.

An inspiring number of first-time candidates ran and won office in 2018, and organizations like @TrainDems were instrumental to those victories. Over 21,000 candidates and activists have signed up for the NDTC‚Äôs trainings, and they‚Äôre just getting started. 
Bill, Chelsea, and I loved seeing @hbrikin's beautiful play #WhatTheConstitutionMeansToMe at @NYTW79. It's an empowering call to consider what it means to be a citizen. Go see it at the Greenwich House Theater if you can! 
On this day, we don't remember the destruction of Pearl Harbor. We remember the selflessness Americans showed that day as they risked themselves to save their fellow servicemembers, and we remember the resilience that followed. To all who served and sacrificed, thank you. 
This is not in line with American values, and it‚Äôs a dangerous path. It's a fundamental building block of democracy that elected representatives respect the outcome of elections. To ignore those outcomes is to silence voters and endanger the health of our democracy itself. 
In Michigan, voters chose Democrats to be governor, attorney general, and secretary of state. Since then, the Republican-controlled legislature has passed bills to gut minimum wage, slash paid sick leave, and limit the new secretary of state's powers. 
Over the last few days, Republicans in Wisconsin's state legislature have pushed through bills to shift power to their Republican-controlled legislature and away from the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general. 
Republicans in Michigan and Wisconsin lost elections on Nov. 6. Rather than respect the will of voters, they're using their last few weeks in office to pass laws limiting the power of new governors and put roadblocks on voting. It's not just anti-Democratic. It's anti-democratic. 
Russia's actions brazenly violate a treaty allowing free passage in the strait and the G7 should hold fast in demanding the sailors' immediate return. 
Russia‚Äôs seizure last week of three Ukrainian boats and their 24 crew members in the Kerch Strait is a significant Russian military escalation with respect to Ukraine and the latest attempt by Russia to control key areas in and around Ukraine. 
Georgia, it's Election Day. Bring a friend with you to vote for Democrat John Barrow in the secretary of state run-off: 
Bill and I will be traveling to Washington to pay our respects to President George H.W. Bush and his family at the funeral this week. We were greatly looking forward to being in Houston for our event this week, and are excited to come back next year as soon as we find a date. 
Georgians have the power on Dec. 4 to help make elections in their state are free and fair again. Make sure your friends and family know to vote for Democrat John Barrow in the run-off to be secretary of state. Polling place and other information here: 
George H.W. Bush was a beloved father grandfather, a war hero, a public servant, a class act. In my experiences w/ him, I always valued his desire to listen, look at evidence ask for ideas, even from people w/ different beliefs. My heart goes out to the entire Bush family. 
NEW POLL: 3 in 4 Americans who buy their own insurance DON'T know the correct deadline to sign up for 2019 coverage. RT to spread the word! You have until *DECEMBER 15* to go to and find an affordable plan that fits your needs. 
In January, Trump quietly made it harder for immigrant children to receive benefits ‚Äî reduced price school lunches, vaccinations, Head Start Medicaid ‚Äî for fear of making it harder for relatives to get visas to come to the U.S. @DemocracyFwd just sued. 
@tarabea80 @BillClinton What kind words Tara. It was great meeting you last night, and thanks for writing! 
I hate talking about emails. I don‚Äôt want to talk about emails. We have so many other things to think about right now that are important to peoples‚Äô lives and need solving, but this nonsense with Ivanka this morning was nothing short of outrageous. 
In less than a week, there will be a run-off in the race to be Georgia's next secretary of state. Georgians deserve a secretary of state who will administer elections fairly and make it easy for every eligible citizen to vote. Help make it happen:

Many of this summer‚Äôs family separation stories have ended happily thanks to an outpouring of support. But as the headlines have receded, the work has continued. Today is a great day to help. 
Kids in Need of Defense, @supportKIND, represents unaccompanied children in court and gives them a chance to be reunited with their families. 
The National Immigrant Justice Center, or @NIJC, helps asylum-seekers win their cases and fights against renewed attempts to separate and jail more families. 
The Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, @RAICESTEXAS, provides representation to families in asylum and immigration hearings. 
This #GivingTuesday, consider giving to support organizations that have spent the last few months working tirelessly to reunite families the administration has separated at the border. Over 200 children are still waiting to be reunited with loved ones. 
Over 300 leading scientists from both inside and outside the government worked on the Fourth National Climate Assessment. You can read it in full here. 
Of course, combating climate change is about more than dollars and cents. It's a moral imperative. Our children and grandchildren deserve to live on a planet that can support their lives, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. 
"Regional economies and industries that depend on natural resources and favorable climate conditions, such as agriculture, tourism, and fisheries, are vulnerable to the growing impacts of climate change." 
"More frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events, as well as changes in average climate conditions, are expected to continue to damage infrastructure, ecosystems, and social systems that provide essential benefits to communities." 
"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century‚Äîmore than the current GDP of many U.S. states." 
The Trump administration tried to bury a federally-mandated climate change study by releasing it the Friday after Thanksgiving. Here's what they didn't want you to hear: 
This is wrong. 
Democracy hangs in the balance on both sides of Atlantic and we need to save it. Can‚Äôt just keep doing the same things. For more, check out my Oxford speech: 
In Europe, nationalists like Hungary‚Äôs Viktor Orban are exploiting this challenge to stoke fear and resentment. To defeat them and protect democracy, the EU needs a more comprehensive policy that builds societies that are both secure and welcoming. 
On both sides of the Atlantic, we need reform. Not open borders, but immigration laws enforced with fairness and respect for human rights. We can‚Äôt let fear or bias force us to give up the values that have made our democracies both great and good. 
In a recent interview, I talked about how Europe must reject right-wing nationalism and authoritarianism, including by addressing migration with courage and compassion. I also gave a comprehensive speech about this last month. 
Trump has made it worse with cruel abuses at the border, detaining children and separating them from their families. It‚Äôs one of the most shameful moments in our history. 
We passed bipartisan comprehensive reform when I was a senator, but House Republicans killed it. Since then, the GOP has refused to make progress and instead uses the issue to divide our country. 
and brings millions of hardworking people into the formal economy, fixes the family visa backlog, upholds the rule of law, and protects our borders and national security. 
I have always been and remain a staunch advocate of comprehensive immigration reform that‚Äôs true to our values and treats every person with dignity, provides a pathway to full and equal citizenship‚Ä¶ 
May we all open our hearts and reach across tables today. May we all find hopes and values in common. May there be pie. Happy Thanksgiving. 
With Republican secretaries of state pursuing voter suppression tactics in states across the country, it's more important than ever that we elect officials who will make sure every eligible citizen can vote. Kudos to @iVoteFund and @KatieHobbs. 
Spend an evening with Bill and me as we discuss where we go from here. Hope to see you out there! 
On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, we remember the names and the lives of those we‚Äôve lost to violence this year:

.@AndrewGillum ran an extraordinary campaign for governor, full of hope and focused on the needs and dreams of Florida families. Andrew, I'm proud of you and I can't wait to see what you do next. 
A wonderful development of this election: Americans elected more than 600 LGBTQ candidates across the country. @victoryinst trained 60 of them. With just 0.1% of elected positions held by LGBTQ people, it has ambitions to build an even bigger #RainbowWave: 
Florida voters: you have until 5 pm on Saturday Nov 17th to cure absentee ballots rejected for signature mismatch. At least 5,000 ballots rejected for this reason Use this form to do it Please RT spread word 
Our fight for full democracy in America must continue, and Stacey is committing to fight for fair elections in Georgia. Let‚Äôs join her: 
Thank you, @StaceyAbrams, for fighting for Georgia and for the integrity of our elections. Everyone should be able to exercise their right to vote. Every vote should be counted. 
Even in 1992, when I first met him, it was clear Chad Griffin would do a lot of good in the world. Little did I know! Grateful for his leadership at @HRC in fighting against discrimination and for marriage equality, and mobilizing millions to build a more just, equal America. 
As of last week, over 200 children in detention near the border are still separated from their families. It's been over 100 days since the deadline for the administration to reunite them. 
Following last week's great elections for Democrats (and our democracy), @arenasummit is laying the groundwork for an even better 2020. Get updates on their upcoming volunteer placement tool, staff and candidate trainings, and summits: 
A state legislator once brushed off Cassandra Levesque‚Äôs campaign to end child marriage in New Hampshire as ‚Äúa request from a minor doing a Girl Scout project.‚Äù So Cassandra, 19 years old, ran for the state legislature herself‚Äîand won. 
Tonight, @cvivianstringer won her 1,000th career victory as a basketball coach. She's just the ninth coach in the history of the sport to reach this milestone, the fifth NCAA Division 1 women's coach and the first African American. Congrats, Coach Stringer, and here‚Äôs to 1,001. 
I hope everyone has a chance to read @MichelleObama's wonderful new memoir, Becoming. Michelle's fierce intelligence, sharp wit, and beautiful soul comes through on every page. Thank you for sharing your story with us, my friend. 
Reproductive rights are human rights. Women's freedom to decide whether and when to have children is core to their liberty as human beings. Today, we celebrate the power to decide. #ThxBirthControl 
Last Tuesday, Americans voted a wave of amazing Democrats into office up and down the ballot, including, for the first time, over 100 women in Congress. This Tuesday, ask someone amazing you know to join them in running for office: 
A brilliant way to draw attention to the equal pay gap: Women in the UK set out-of-office notifications this weekend saying they'll be out for the final six weeks of the year they'll be working "for free." 
The final margin in the race for Senate in Florida is too close to call, and the Secretary of State has just ordered a recount. Help make sure Senator Nelson's team has everything they need for this process, and that every vote is counted: 
My heart goes out to everyone affected by the fires in California. People have lost loved ones, pets, and homes, and the fires are still going. If you'd like to help, here are a few organizations that are working locally to support survivors: 
Deeply humbled to be coming to @RutgersU to honor the life and legacy of Anita Datar, and to speak about how we can continue her essential work of championing women‚Äôs access to health care - around the globe and here at home. 
URGENT We need your help in Florida! The Nelson for Senate campaign needs lawyers and nonlawyers to help staff the recount. If you can spare the time, please help join the effort. FOR NONLAWYER: FOR LAWYERS: 
So proud of my friend @Ann_OLeary, who was just announced as Governor @GavinNewsom‚Äôs chief of staff. Ann is brilliant, hard-working, and kind. I know her team will do great things for California. 
The election in Georgia isn't over, and @staceyabrams needs your help! If you cast a provisional ballot on Tuesday, get to your county election office ASAP! Go to right now to find where to go, or call 866-OUR-VOTE for info. #TeamAbrams 
Like our amazing partners, we're just getting started. If you'd like to join our team, sign up here: 
Thank you all for your service to your country. Take a well-deserved rest, and then let's keep going. 
.@alliance4youth, @IndivisibleTeam, and @swingleft set about organizing locally to mobilize young people and win back Congress. I truly don't think we would have won back the House without them. 
.@iVoteFund has defended democracy itself, fighting hard against voter suppression and for secretaries of state and local measures that will make it easier for every American to exercise their right to vote. 
.@ColorOfChange and @DomesticWorkers have spent the last two years waging campaigns to defend civil rights against the administration's attacks and building powerful communities for change. 
.@LatinoVictoryUS and @VotoLatino have worked to mobilize Latino voters and elect progressive Latino candidates, sending dozens of amazing candidates to office up and down the ballot. 
.@arenasummit, @CollectivePAC, @EmergeAmerica, and @runforsomething have collectively recruited, trained, and supported hundreds of candidates up and down the ballot. They are building a Democratic bench, candidate by candidate and race by race. 
These organizations are recruiting a new Democratic bench, defending rights, and organizing locally to fight for progressive policies that improve people's lives. I'm so proud. 
Thanks and congratulations to all our @OnwardTogether partners for two years of hard work that paid off in a big way this week. 
Georgians, spread the word: The deadline is 5pm today for people who voted with paper ballots to make sure their votes are counted. 
URGENT: Democrats--please share. 
Georgia voters: If you voted with a provisional ballot on Tuesday, make sure your ballot will be counted as votes continue to be tallied in the governor's race. 
Congratulations to Lucy McBath for winning her race for Georgia's sixth congressional district. Lucy entered public life after her son, Jordan, was shot and killed. Now, she's brought her voice to Congress in the fight to prevent gun violence. Onward, Lucy! 
I have the lead - but this race is far from over. We are locked into a recount in a battle for #GA06. I NEED your support so we can win this fight. Will you rush $10, $15 or more to help us protect our victory? DONATE ‚û°Ô∏è 
Our work is far from over. As we celebrate our wins, let's be clear about what's ahead. This is a crucial step in a long road to repairing our democracy. It'll take all of us to do it. What a start this is. 
Win or lose, what you've built will continue long after last night. 
None of these victories would have been possible if people had simply given up after the heartbreak of 2016. They belong to all the volunteers and candidates who worked impossible hours, logged hundreds of miles, and knocked on countless doors. 
There were important wins for rights, too, including Floridians voting to restore the voting rights of 1 million of their fellow citizens and Nevada approving automatic voter registration. 
These historic firsts are important not just because representation matters (and it does), but because these extraordinary women will bring perspectives that have been absent from our policy debates for far too long. 
The inspiring Lucy McBath became an activist for common-sense gun reform after her son, Jordan, was shot and killed. This cycle, she ran for Congress in a heavily Republican district in Georgia‚Äîand it looks likely she will win. 
Janet Mills will be the first woman governor of Maine. Cindy Axne and Abby Finkenauer will be the first women to represent Iowa in the House. Finkenauer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are the youngest women to be elected to Congress ever. 
Ayanna Pressley and Jahana Hayes will be the first black women to represent Massachusetts and Connecticut in Congress, respectively. Tish James will be the first black woman to be New York's attorney general. 
Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland will be the first Native American women to ever serve in Congress. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar will be the first Muslim women to serve. 
It was a historic night in so many ways: For the first time ever, over 100 women were elected to Congress‚Äîincluding a record number of women of color. 
Congratulations to all the voters, volunteers, organizers, and candidates who voted last night to put a powerful check on this administration and start building a better future for everyone in our country.

Study after study shows that one of the best ways to get out the vote is to talk to potential voters in person the week before the election. It's not too late to sign up to help, and to bring a friend along with you: 
It's more important than ever this week to remember the children who have still not been reunited with their families after this administration separated them at the border months ago. Vote to repudiate this horrendous policy. Vote to reject the bigotry that led to it. 
People are more likely to vote when their friends nudge them to vote. They're also more likely to vote when they have a plan to vote. So ask a friend today: "What's your plan to vote?" 
There's a concrete way you can help immigrant children and their families at the border today. The Trump administration wants to change regulations to allow indefinite detention. Make a public comment to DHS about why you oppose the policy: 
Imagine if we all used our voice? Let's show the power of the Latinx vote. Find your polling place. Let's do this.

#TeamMari is excited to announce that we received the endorsement of @HillaryClinton! We are one of just 19 @runforsomething campaigns around the country to earn Sec. Clinton's support. With just 8 days to go, we're ready to bring this thing home for #MIHD40. #MariforMI 
I'm thrilled today to endorse 19 @runforsomething candidates. These thoughtful young people are committed to serving their communities and they'll bring fresh perspectives and new solutions to public office. I can't wait to see what they accomplish. 
Governors set the tone and direction for their states. They‚Äôre also our last line of defense against some of the Trump administration‚Äôs worst policies. So pick a candidate‚Äîor two or three‚Äîand help flip one of these 17 races. One week to go. 
.@GretchenWhitmer never backs down from tackling the problems facing Michigan‚Äôs working families, and she was a key leader in addressing Detroit‚Äôs financial crisis. The Flint water crisis was a powerful motivator in Gretchen‚Äôs decision to jump in the race. 
.@JanetMillsforME is an experienced leader and an outstanding public servant running for governor of Maine to expand economic opportunity. She currently serves as the state‚Äôs attorney general and is a tireless champion for Maine families. 
.@NHMollyKelly is an experienced leader and tireless fighter running for New Hampshire governor. She‚Äôll fight to improve economic security for working families and expand opportunity for all. 
.@MarkBegich is a dedicated public servant, business owner, and former U.S. senator who has a record of cutting through bureaucracy to get things done for Alaskans. In office, he'll prioritize schools, jobs, and affordable health care. 
.@dg4az is a husband, dad, veteran and teacher who will fight for education and root out corruption in Arizona. David is a national education expert who will invest in schools so all of Arizona‚Äôs children can live up to their God-given potential. 
In one week, we have the chance to flip 17 governorships from red to blue. Here are four incredible candidates who deserve your support: 
It was such a delight to talk with the @BGTX team tonight. They‚Äôre turning Texas into a battleground state by treating it like one, from endorsing an all-women slate of candidates to registering 55,000 voters this cycle. Hard work pays off. Keep it going‚Äîeight more days! #GameOn 
My thoughts are with everyone affected by this morning‚Äôs horrific shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We can and must put a stop to this violence and this hate. It should have no home in America. 
We are forever grateful to have known him and will always be proud members of #GayleNation. 
He spent his 30 years doing all the good he could, in all the ways he could, for as long as he could. Our prayers are with Tyrone‚Äôs family, especially his wife, Beth, and their huge community of devoted friends. 
Whatever he did, he did with his whole heart‚Äîwhether he was running sprints, planning his wedding to the love of his life, rooting for his beloved Clemson Tigers, or working to build an America as kind, compassionate, and big-hearted as Tyrone himself. 
The HFA family lost Tyrone Gayle last night. He was one of the fiercest fighters we will ever know. 
Matthew‚Äôs parents, Judy and Dennis, lobbied hard for the Matthew Shepard James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act. They knew it wouldn't bring their son back, but they wanted other LGBT people to have that protection and justice. May their example inspire us all in these times. 
Matthew Shepard's ashes were laid to rest in the Washington National Cathedral today. Two days later, we‚Äôll mark the nine-year anniversary of President Obama signing a law that bears Matthew‚Äôs name. 
With the midterm elections less than two weeks away, now is the time to take action‚Äîespecially in state races. We‚Äôre working with progressive candidates across 10 states to flip crucial seats and chambers blue on November 6th. Here‚Äôs why (and where you can get involved): 
Nebraskans, today's your deadline to register to vote. Check your registration and spread the word to your friends and family: 
America is one of the oldest democracies in the world, and voting is our most sacred right as citizens. Let's make it easy for every single American to cast a ballot. 
Fourth, vote for state legislature candidates and governors who will support laws that make voting registration automatic, make vote by mail possible, and extend early voting periods. @Sister_District, @flippable_org, and @TheDLCC are excellent organizations to plug into. 
Third, help elect secretaries of state around the country who will work to make it easier for people to cast their ballots. @iVoteFund is leading the charge here. 
Second, know that if you're a registered voter, you have the right to vote. This @ACLU guide walks you through your rights. 
What can we do to protect our right to vote? First, know that it's still likely that you'll be able to vote quickly and easily. Problems in some areas doesn't mean there are problems everywhere. 
Republican lawmakers justify such laws because they protect against "voter fraud." But "voter fraud" has been proven in study after study to be a virtually non-existent problem, with incidence rates between 0.0003 percent and 0.0025 percent. 
In Texas, groups like @TXCivilRights and @MOVE_Texas argue that officials' decision to limit early voting at college campus sites specifically targets students. 
Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, is overseeing his own election for governor and has put 53,000 voter registrations on hold, 70% of them from black voters, because they don't adhere to an "exact match" standard of name spellings. 
In this cycle, Native Americans are scrambling for IDs because of a new voting law that requires them to use identification that lists a street address rather than a P.O. box, which many who live on reservations have used for years. 
Fast-forward a few years: 24 states have put new voting restrictions in place since 2010, including photo ID rules in Alabama, "use it or lose it" laws in Ohio, and "exact match" laws in Georgia. 
First, some history. The 2013 Supreme Court case Shelby v. Holder gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act by ruling that states with a history of voter suppression no longer needed the federal government to approve changes to voting rules. 
Let's talk about voter suppression, how you can protect your rights in this election, and how we can fight to make America a place where every citizen can make their voice heard. 
Reproductive rights are human rights‚Äîall around the world. 
It was wonderful spending time in Florida yesterday campaigning with some familiar faces. Make sure Floridians in your life know how lucky they are to get the chance to vote for @AndrewGillum for governor and @DonnaShalala for Congress! 
.@EmergeAmerica has recruited and trained thousands of Democratic women to run for office, and 560 of their alums will be on the ballot in two weeks. Historic numbers of women are running all over the country. We're at the beginning of a new era. 
I'm grateful for the hard work and commitment of the Secret Service every day, and never more than this week. 
Hillary Clinton in Florida: "We are fine thanks to the men and women of the Secret Service ... Every day, we are grateful for their service and committment. And obviously, never more than today. But it is a troubling time, isn't it?" 
I have been beaten, my skull fractured, and arrested more than forty times so that each and every person has the right to register and vote. Friends of my gave their lives. Do your part. Get out there and vote like you‚Äôve never voted before. #vote #goodtrouble 
The elections two weeks from today are our chance to put a check on an administration that has undermined the rule of law, brought corruption into the Oval Office, attacked immigrants, and vilified journalists. Do more than vote this year. Volunteer: 
Whatever you choose to do, do something. With only two weeks before the election, we don't have a moment to lose. 
.@TheDLCC recruits, trains, and supports local Democrats running for state legislative office. They provide candidates with field support, data, and other resources. (They also have a great new podcast.) Listen and pitch in to support their mission: 
.@Flippable_org is supporting more than 130 candidates in strategic states to flip legislative chambers, build progressive majorities, and restore democracy. Read their plan for your state, then pitch in and volunteer: 
.@Sister_District makes it easy for anyone, anywhere to get involved in a state legislature race. And as their volunteers can tell you, it's fun. Join them in these last two weeks before the election: 
There are many organizations doing great work in the states, but I'd like to highlight three in particular‚Äîincluding two @OnwardTogether partners, @Sister_District and @Flippable_org: 
State legislature races are also a great way to make an impact as an activist. The budgets and walk lists are smaller than those of congressional races, so you can move the needle with a few volunteer hours or donations. 
Winning back state legislatures is also important in this last election before the 2020 Census. State legislatures redraw congressional districts every 10 years based on those numbers, and Democratic legislative majorities can shut down gerrymandering that disenfranchises voters. 
State legislatures with Democratic majorities can help preserve access to the ballot for people of color, reproductive freedoms for women, the rights of LGBTQ people, protections for immigrants, Medicaid expansions, and more. 
A reality of a Supreme Court with a right-wing majority is that the states are a new important front in protecting civil rights‚Äîespecially the rights of the most vulnerable among us. 
A reality of a Supreme Court with a right-wing majority is that the states are a new important front in protecting civil rights‚Äîespecially the rights of the most vulnerable among us. 
Alabama, California, South Dakota: Your deadline to register to vote is today. Time to check your voter registration and get your friends and family to do the same. 
This is an attack on the humanity of transgender people and it cannot stand. Let's send a clear message that we won't sit back and allow this type of discrimination in two weeks at the ballot box. 
I agree with the @LATimes: Fiona Ma should be California's next treasurer. 
Seventy-eight congressional districts will determine whether or not we flip the House in three weeks. Find out if you live in one‚Äîthen recruit your friends and neighbors to make a plan to vote: 
What are you ready to flip states for? Now‚Äôs your chance to make it happen. This Saturday is the 2018 Day of Action. We‚Äôre texting, calling, and talking face-to-face with voters in 10 different states. And we need you with us. 
As Secretary of State, Brian Kemp oversaw the cancellation of 1.4 million voter registrations since 2012. Now his office his blocking 53,000 voter registration applications from being processed, 70% are from Black Georgians. This suppression must stop! 
We're counting down the final 20 days until the elections with a series of 20 images we're calling #VOTERIA! Each card will remind Latinx voters just how high the stakes are, by highlighting issues of importance to Latinxs. 
Early voting helps us win. Vote and help spread the word in these states: [deep breath] Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wyoming 
Good morning to everyone who has already made a plan to canvass and phonebank this weekend Ready to help GOTV and build the #BlueWave? 
North Dakota tribes need $100K to get tribal IDs to voters, after ND Republicans attempt to disenfranchise them. Daily Kos is raising the money for the effort, and WOAH within the first few minutes we're already at $34,000! Let's finish strong: 
.@TinaSmithMN shares some qualities with her wonderful home state: hardworking, no-nonsense, huge heart. She's in a tight race to keep working for Minnesota families in a race that could decide control of the Senate. Pitch in if you can: 
The administration's deadline to reunite families it separated at the border passed 12 weeks ago today. What is their plan to rectify this great wrong, and to do it immediately? 
Today is the final deadline to register to vote in Nevada. Help get the word out: 
Make sure any South Carolinians or Wisconsinites you know don't miss their chance to vote. Both states' voter registration deadlines are today: 
Whatever you do, do something. These midterm elections are our last chance to defend our democracy. Let's win.

Eleven weeks ago, the administration was supposed to finish reunifying families it separated at the border. Eleven weeks on, families are still waiting and wondering when they'll see their loved ones again. Every additional minute they wait is an injustice. 
Join me, @ChrisMurphyCT, @TimKaine, and a host of Democratic senators and gun violence prevention organizations to help these folks get elected. Chip in today to their campaigns, and your support will be split equally among them. Let‚Äôs beat the NR8. 
.@ColinAllredTX, @JenniferWexton, @RosenForNevada, @JasonCrow06, @WildForCongress, @Lizzie4Congress, @Joshua_Harder, and @MikeLevinCA are working hard to talk to voters about how gun violence has affected their lives, and what we can all do to make our communities safer. 
We have another chance to make progress this fall, when eight brave candidates for Congress will be on the ballot facing some of the gun lobby's biggest defenders. 
They told me about their grief, and also about their anger and frustration toward a political system that couldn‚Äôt seem to take action to prevent other kids from dying from unnecessary gun violence. 
Some of the most painful and rewarding conversations I have had on the campaign trail were with parents who had lost their children to gun violence. 
Democracy means debating and compromising, participating in shared institutions, and honoring the rights and needs of all citizens. I was honored to share this message at Queen's University Belfast today. 
The world is watching. Northern Ireland has been a symbol to people everywhere of democracy‚Äôs power to transcend divisions and deliver prosperity, peace, and progress. We need that symbol, that reality, now more than ever. 
Democracy is a habit. It must be practiced again and again. Yes, that means voting. But it also means debating and compromising, participating in shared institutions, and honoring the rights and needs of all citizens. 
It‚Äôs crucial that however it comes out, Brexit should not be allowed to undermine the peace and prosperity that has been so dearly won here. 
I do not come today as an authority with all the answers‚Äîonly you will find those‚Äîbut as a friend who knows how hard the people of Northern Ireland have worked and suffered to transcend old conflicts. You deserve a future worthy of that struggle. 
About to speak at beautiful Queen's University in Belfast to talk about all that‚Äôs been achieved in the 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement, and what the future can hold for all of us.

I spoke at Oxford University today about the challenges ahead of us, both abroad and at home, and how we can come together to meet them for the sake of our democracy: 
Now is the time to bring human rights out of the ivory tower and into what Eleanor Roosevelt called "small places close to home"‚Äîinto neighborhoods and schools, offices, factories, and farms, and the hearts and daily interactions of men and women everywhere. 
In the years since, in country after country, human rights have come to be seen not as a high-minded luxury but as a core national interest. But we have urgent work to do. 
Seventy years ago this December, 58 countries came together at the end of World War II to offer the world a roadmap for peace and prosperity strong enough to withstand the appeals of demagogues and the ravages of poverty and fear. 
Today, October 9, is the final deadline to register to vote in this critical election if you live in one of these states. Check your registration today, and tell a friend:

With a historic number of women running this year, we have a tremendous opportunity to make our government better reflect our country. We'd all be lucky to see these four extraordinary candidates win their races for Congress this fall: 
A reported 211 families are still waiting to be reunited since the administration separated them at the border. It's been a full eight weeks since the deadline to reunite them, and we all need to continue speaking out about this inexcusable delay. #FamiliesBelongTogether 
The "authoritarian tendencies that we have seen at work in this admin, with this president, left unchecked, could very well result in the erosion of our institutions to an extent that we've never imagined possible here," @HillaryClinton told @Maddow 
Hillary to @maddow: "I don't know whether Trump is a witting or unwitting tool of Putin. I don't know that. But it's clear he's playing checkers Putin is playing 3 dimensional chess." 
JUST IN: Hillary Clinton tells @Maddow that she predicts that President Trump "is going to wholesale fire people" after the midterms, and "he will be even more uncontrollable" if the Democrats don't flip one or more houses of Congress. 
Democracy works only when we accept that we‚Äôre in this together. We can‚Äôt just ask, ‚ÄúAm I better off than I was four years ago?‚Äù We have to ask, ‚ÄúAre we better off? Are we as a country better, stronger, and fairer?‚Äù Ultimately, healing our country will come down to each of us. 
Above all, we need to find a way to restitch our fraying social fabric and rekindle our civic spirit. We need to bring back civics education in our schools. We need systemic economic reforms that reduce inequality and give a strong voice to working families. 
We need to improve and protect our elections, from instituting paper ballot backups to repairing the Voting Rights Act, getting secret money out of politics, and‚Äîyou won't be surprised to hear my support for this‚Äîabolishing the Electoral College. 
Then, we need to do some housecleaning. Just as Nixon‚Äôs abuses of power led to reforms, post-Trump all future presidential candidates should be required by law to release their tax returns. They also should not be exempt from ethics requirements and conflict-of-interest rules. 
First: We‚Äôve got to mobilize turnout in the midterms. There are fantastic candidates all over the country who‚Äôll do great things, and we could finally see some congressional oversight of the White House. 
With our democracy in crisis and our institutions and traditions under siege, we need to do everything we can to fight back. Here's how. 
Whether it was stealing a Supreme Court seat, gerrymandering congressional districts to disenfranchise African Americans, or muzzling government climate scientists, Republicans were undermining American democracy long before Trump made it to the Oval Office. 
We should be clear about this: The increasing radicalism and irresponsibility of the Republican Party, including decades of demeaning government, demonizing Democrats, and debasing norms, is what gave us Donald Trump. 
There is a tendency, when talking about these things, to wring our hands about "both sides." But the truth is that this is not a symmetrical problem. 
Donald Trump refuses to be subject to the law. The legitimacy of our elections is in doubt. The president is waging war on the truth. The administration is undermining the national unity that makes democracy possible. And then there's the breathtaking corruption. 
On the day after the election, I hoped my fears for our country's future were overblown. They were not. 
I've written a new afterword for "What Happened" breaking down what we've learned since it was published, how we got here, and how we can heal our body politic. The new edition is available today:

My new afterword for "What Happened" is excerpted in @TheAtlantic. It's about the constitutional crisis building in our democracy and why we should all be focused, determined and, yes, optimistic as we work to save our country. 
In sum: Kavanaugh doesn't think judges should consider public safety or allow common-sense gun laws. Meanwhile, 96 Americans are killed with guns every day. Call your senators: (202) 224-3121 
‚ÄúGun bans and gun regulations that are not longstanding or sufficiently rooted in the text, history and tradition are not consistent with the Second Amendment individual right," he added. 
Judge Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. appeals court ruled in 2011 that the city could ban semiautomatic rifles and require handgun registration. He argued that courts shouldn't consider the public safety benefits of gun laws: "Our task is to apply the Constitution." 
Let's talk about Brett Kavanaugh's past rulings on guns. He's out of the mainstream, even among other conservative judges, in his willingness to strike down legislatures' public safety measures to prevent gun violence if they don't align with his politics. 
The administration is now seven weeks late in meeting its deadline to reunite families they separated at the border. Hundreds of families have spent the past seven weeks waiting and worrying. There's no possible excuse for continuing to keep them apart. #FamiliesBelongTogether 
Congrats to the great @barb_kinney on her new book collecting her photos from the campaign trail in 2016. She captured the joy and exhaustion and energy of it all, from late nights on the plane to being backstage with Beyonc√©. Out November 1st!

Let‚Äôs be clear: Women have just as much right as men to make the most personal health decisions without government interference. We are equal citizens and we will insist on nothing less in this country. Please call your senators and relay the message: (202) 224-3121 
Sen. @kamalaharris asked Brett Kavanaugh last week: "Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?" He said he was not. Because there are none. 
Imagine an America in which women are barred from getting IUDs or birth control pills, and doctors are criminalized for prescribing them. It's an America in which women would be punished for insisting on being full and equal partners in society. 
When Kavanaugh called birth control "abortion-inducing drugs," he made it clear that safe and legal abortion isn't the only fundamental reproductive right at grave risk if he is confirmed. Access to birth control is, too. 
Kavanaugh didn't use that term because he misunderstands the basic science of birth control‚Äîthe fact that birth control prevents fertilization of eggs in the first place. He used that term because it's a dog whistle to the extreme right. 
I want to be sure we're all clear about something that Brett Kavanaugh said in his confirmation hearings last week. He referred to birth-control pills as "abortion-inducing drugs." That set off a lot of alarm bells for me, and it should for you, too. 
May we always remember those we lost 17 years ago. May the love, bravery, and selflessness so many showed that day light our path forward. 
When women are paid less for doing the same work as their male peers, it affects us all. @HillaryClinton weighs in for this week‚Äôs episode of Explained about the gender wage gap. Watch now on @Netflix. 
This took courage. Thank you, David, for speaking out. Now let‚Äôs turn to the future and mobilize people for the midterms. 
We're not fighting for the planet in some abstract sense here. We're fighting for our continued ability to live on it. Call your senators: (202) 224-3121 
Just last year, Kavanaugh ruled that the EPA's attempt to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a particularly dangerous greenhouse gas found in refrigeration and air conditioning units, was outside its authority. 
In 2016, he argued that the Clean Air Act was a "thin statute" to support the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants. 
Kavanaugh wrote a majority opinion for the D.C. Circuit Court in 2012 that struck down a federal program to curb cross-state pollution from power plants. 
During the Obama years, Kavanaugh came down against the EPA in every one of the three major cases he heard about the agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases. 
Replacing Kennedy with Kavanaugh would swing the Court to a new, hard-right majority that would rule against curbing greenhouse gases for years‚Äîmaybe decades‚Äîthat we can‚Äôt afford to waste on inaction. 
Kavanaugh would replace Justice Kennedy, who was the deciding vote in a pivotal 2007 Supreme Court case that established greenhouse gases were "well within" the EPA's authority to regulate under the Clean Air Act and made it possible for the agency to start reining in emissions. 
Kavanaugh has consistently argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has limited authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon and other pollutants that are causing the planet to heat up. 
This year has seen record-high temperatures across the world, the biggest wildfire in California history, and an unprecedented red tide in Florida. It's urgent that we act to curb climate change‚Äîand Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court could make progress virtually impossible. 
Six weeks after the administration's deadline to reunify families, 497 children are still waiting. 
Want to run for office or join a campaign but unsure of how to get started? If you're near Philadelphia, consider attending the @ArenaSummit this weekend. It‚Äôs a gathering for the next generation of civic leaders: 
This fight isn't over until it's over, and the only thing we can count on in this era is that these battles won't always end the way we expect they will. Share the number of the Senate switchboard with a friend right now: 202-224-3121 
Just this year, the Court upheld purges of minority voters in Ohio as well as districts in Texas that were drawn to reduce the voting power of people of color. With a solid hard-right majority on the Court, we would see more decisions like those. 
The Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013 by ruling that states with a history of suppression no longer needed federal approval to change their voting laws. Kavanaugh's record indicates he would help a new majority kill the VRA entirely and approve even more suppression. 
Voter fraud‚Äîthe justification for voter ID laws‚Äîhas also been proven to be a virtually nonexistent problem. A recent Brennan Center report noted that an American is more likely to be struck by lightning than to impersonate someone else at the polls. 
He wrote approvingly of "recent changes to voting laws" that include not just voter ID but also laws that put restrictions on registration and cut back on both early voting days and polling place locations. All these changes are shown to disproportionately affect voters of color. 
Kavanaugh voted in 2012 to uphold a South Carolina voter ID law that the Obama administration found would disenfranchise 80,000 minority voters. 
Today's reason to call your senators and urge them to #StopKavanaugh: Kavanaugh would help kill the Voting Rights Act and uphold voter suppression laws that make it harder for voters of color to cast ballots. 
If you agree, please pick up the phone right now and call your senators. Ask them to #StopKavanaugh: (202) 224-3121 
One of the most fundamental human rights is the right to make the most personal decisions about one's own body. To deny women that is to rob them of the ability to decide their own futures. 
It's remarkable that we have to keep repeating this, even in 2018: Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights. 
Anti-abortion groups have endorsed Kavanaugh, considering him a reliable vote to overturn Roe. His confirmation would be a victory for activists who want to end a woman's right to make her own health decisions. 
Kavanaugh ruled to let CEOs decide to deny their employees insurance coverage for no co-pay birth control. 
As a federal judge, Kavanaugh tried to prevent a young undocumented woman in government custody from exercising her right to an abortion. 
A few weeks before Kavanaugh's name appeared on President Trump's short list for a new justice, Kavanaugh praised the dissent in the Roe v. Wade case and called former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist his ‚Äúhero,‚Äù noting that ‚Äúhe clearly wanted to overrule Roe.‚Äù 
If Brett Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court justice, will he help gut or overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in America? Yes, of course he will. 
This is as serious as it gets. It's up to us to save health care for millions of our fellow Americans‚Äîagain. As Kavanaugh's hearings begin, make sure your senators hear from you: (202) 224-3121 
Supreme Court seats are for life. Your senators' votes on Kavanaugh could affect whether you, your loved ones, and millions of other Americans can get affordable health care for decades. 
Kavanaugh has also claimed that the president can simply decide not to implement the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions of Americans in the lurch. 
In 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Court upheld the consitutionality of the ACA. In 2017, he criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for ruling to uphold the law five years earlier. 
The next Supreme Court justice will have a chance to rule on the fate of the Affordable Care Act, which helps millions of people get affordable health care. Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs record shows he‚Äôd be a threat to the law. 
Challenges to the Affordable Care Act's protections for patients, including the notion that insurance companies can't refuse to insure you if you have a pre-existing condition, are already working their way through the lower courts. 
Do you have a pre-existing condition? Do you care about someone who has one? Could you or someone you love ever get one? Then you should call your senators today to #StopKavanaugh from getting a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. Here's why: 
Unions and labor movements are why we have workplace safety precautions, collective bargaining, weekends, minimum wages, and, yes, Labor Day. We can't afford more damage to workers' rights. Make sure your senators hear from you: Let's #StopKavanaugh. 
In 2016, Kavanaugh held that corporations have the right to punish workers for displaying pro-union signs in their cars. 
In 2014, he dissented in a case where the Occupational Safety and Health Administration held SeaWorld accountable for the death of a trainer. 
In 2007, Kavanaugh wrote an opinion that severely limited union rights and allowed major damage to federal workers' ability to bargain collectively. 
In other words, the Court has already been widening the disparity in power between corporations and workers. Kavanaugh's record from his time as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shows he'd help further that trend for a generation. 
The Court has also recently granted corporations the right to deny workers reproductive health care and made it harder for workers to sue businesses by allowing companies to force employees to sign mandatory arbitration clauses with their contracts. 
That ruling won't just hurt seven million public-sector union workers with contracts. It'll hurt all workers, because union deals on wages and working conditions affect what businesses without unions do, too. 
The Court's ruling in Janus v. AFSCME earlier this summer overturned a 40-year-old precedent to hold that public-sector workers with union contracts don't have to pay fees for collective bargaining expenses if they're not members. 
The Roberts Court has dealt some big blows to workers and unions in the last few years. With Kavanaugh on the Court, a 5-4 hard-right majority would be even more aggressive in siding with corporations over people. 
Happy Labor Day. There's no better time to talk about why workers‚Äô rights would suffer if Brett Kavanaugh, whose hearings for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court start tomorrow, is confirmed. 
Vladimir Putin has waged a 30-year campaign to disrupt world events, including our last election. I talked about it in @ActMeasuresDoc, a fascinating summation of the Russia story that premieres today: 
Today's celebration of Aretha Franklin's life was like the lady herself: Joyful, profound, and full of song. Thank you to everyone who performed, spoke in remembrance, and made it a send-off worthy of her. 
Over 500 children are still waiting to be reunited with their parents, five weeks after the administration's deadline to reunify families. Every day they are made to wait is a tragedy. 
We're only 10 weeks out from the midterm elections. Have you answered Michelle's call to help get out the vote? 
We have to be better than this. Make sure your representatives continue to hear from you that families belong together, and give what you can to the efforts to reunite these children with their families. 
These are just a few of countless stories that we should never read about events happening within our borders. 
This heartbreaking video from the ACLU shows the consequences of separation: 
Child welfare officials in Texas are investigating the death of a young girl who died after alleged inadequate treatment while she was being held with her mother in a detention facility: 
The administration is deporting people back to slavery: 
First, it‚Äôs been nearly five weeks since the deadline for the administration to reunite families they separated at the border, but 528 children are still waiting to see their parents again. 
There's a lot going on right now‚Äîunderstatement of the year. The separation of families and the failure of the administration to reunite them has been eclipsed in the news in recent days, but these tragic circumstances persist. Here are some of the latest developments:

People are mobilizing across the country today to #StopKavanaugh. Find an event near you: 
The next Supreme Court justice could shift the court to the right for decades, with devastating consequences for reproductive rights, health care, workers' rights, and voting rights. 
.@SenJohnMcCain lived a life of service to his country, from his heroism in the Navy to 35 years in Congress. He was a tough politician, a trusted colleague, and there will simply never be another like him. My thoughts and prayers are with Cindy and his entire family. 
A full month has passed since the deadline for the administration to reunite families it separated at the border, but 565 children are still waiting to see their parents again. #FamiliesBelongTogether 
There are only 77 days until the midterms. Are you registered and ready to vote? 
This is a heart-wrenching disgrace. 
.@SwingLeft is a national network of volunteers who have signed up to adopt a congressional swing district near them and turn it blue. We only need 23 seats to flip the House‚Äîfind out how you can help: 
.@SwingLeft is a national network of volunteers who have signed up to adopt a congressional swing district near them and turn it blue. We only need 23 seats to flip the House‚Äîfind out how you can help: 
.@LatinoVictoryUS is dedicated to electing Latino candidates to all levels of government, building Latino political power, and "making Trump furious." 
.@LeahGreenB and @EzraLevin are former congressional staffers who started a Google Doc for citizens who wanted to have more of a voice in their government. It became @IndivisibleTeam‚Äîa grassroots network of advocates around the country. 
I‚Äôd like to encourage you to support some extraordinary organizations we're proud to have on the @OnwardTogether team: 
It's been three weeks since the deadline for the administration to reunify families it separated at the border. Today, 565 children are still reportedly separated from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether 
6 years ago nearly 700,000 young people got relief from deportation under the DACA program. Organizations like @votolatino and @kslaw are keeping the flame alive by helping #DACA recipients pay their application fees. Chip in here: 
Mourning the loss today of @ArethaFranklin who shared her spirit and talent with the world. She deserves not only our RESPECT but also our lasting gratitude for opening our eyes, ears and hearts. Rest in eternal peace, my friend. 
It takes courage to exercise your right to protest injustice, especially when you‚Äôre 11! Keep up the good work Mariana. 
One of the most stunning statistics from the 2016 election is that nearly 42% of eligible voters didn't vote. Historically, midterm turnout is even lower than the turnout rate for presidential years. But we can't afford for anyone to stay home. 
@itsmebeccam @TATLGDoc I‚Äôm so proud of you Rebecca. And you should be proud of all you‚Äôve accomplished. There‚Äôs a bright future ahead! 
So proud of the @runforsomething team on hitting this milestone! It takes a lot of courage to put your name on a ballot, and I'm glad these 500+ candidates have Run for Something in their corner. 
If your friends and family aren't registered, they can't make their voices heard in this fall's critical midterm elections. Take one minute right now to share this link with them via text, email, Facebook message, or carrier pigeon: 
.@KingJames is a great family man, incredible ballplayer, gives back to his community, and isn‚Äôt afraid to speak his mind. He‚Äôs a world class athlete and a class act. We need more like him in this world. 
We‚Äôre in the fight of our lives to protect our most fundamental rights and freedoms. The confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh would put so much at stake, and we cannot back down. Join us on August 26th at events across all 50 states to stop Kavanaugh: 
This wknd, we launched our first-ever #VotingWhileBlack Leadership Training. The 2-day bootcamp is our plan to give 1,000+ Black ppl the skills they need to win back our country. Help us bring this training to #Detroit next: 
It's been a week since the deadline for the administration to reunify families it split up at the border. More than 559 children are still reportedly separated from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether 
.@realDonaldTrump has sabotaged the Affordable Care Act and driven up the cost of health insurance. #TrumpSabotage hurts families and violates the Constitution, so Columbus, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago other Americans are taking Trump to court. More: 
Hillary Clinton is teaming with Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television to bring Elaine Weiss' critically acclaimed book 'The Woman's Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote' to the small screen. The drama will mark Clinton's debut as an exec producer 
I‚Äôm thrilled to be joining forces with Steven Spielberg to bring @efweiss5‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Woman‚Äôs Hour‚Äù to TV. It‚Äôs about the women who fought for suffrage nearly 100 years ago. We stand on their shoulders, and I‚Äôm delighted to have a hand in helping to tell their stories. 
Thank you, @LIRSorg, for your tireless work to help reunified families rebuild their lives. Everyone can be a part of these efforts‚Äîhere‚Äôs one way to share your support. 
As of today, there are 14 weeks until the midterm election, and they'll go by in a flash. Are your friends and family registered and ready to vote? 
Congrats to @IndivisibleTeam volunteers around the country for hosting and running 150+ events this weekend to reach out to voters one conversation at a time. For anyone who's not on the team yet, don't miss out‚Äîjoin here! 
This is a humanitarian crisis being perpetrated by our own government. Thanks for raising awareness, @MarkRuffalo and @common. 
Give them all a follow, a RT, or an email sign-up‚Äîyou won't regret it. You can also sign up for updates from Onward Together here: 
After Justice Kennedy announced his retirement from the Supreme Court, @WeDemandJustice leapt into action to launch a movement to #StopKavanaugh. They're doing a 10-city #RiseUpForRoe tour and will have a day of action on 8/26: 
.@VotoLatino is working to engage Latinos in the civic process. They recently helped register 5,000 people in just one day at March For Our Lives events. Their goal: register 422,000 voters for the 2018 midterms and turn out 80% of those people. 
.@CollectivePAC recruits, trains, and funds progressive black candidates at every level of government. They've helped elect 23 officials so far and are doing a series of trainings for candidates and operatives with the goal of training 200 people by 2019 and 2020. 
When @RunForSomething launched, they expected to find 100 people who wanted to run for local office. Instead, they've recruited 17,000 young candidates in all 50 states, built a network of 6,000 volunteers, and endorsed 308 candidates. Their new goal: recruit 50k candidates. 
We had our first annual @OnwardTogether members call yesterday. Thank you to the thousands of members who joined. We had a chance to hear from a few of our partner groups about the progress they're making to strengthen our democracy. I want to share some of it with you. 
Such a pleasure seeing @BetteMidler back where she belongs! Huge thanks to the cast and crew of @HelloDollyBway for a joyful night (I'll never wash this cheek again)! 
Yesterday was the court-ordered deadline for the administration to reunite families it has separated at the border, but more than 700 children are not yet back with their parents. Let‚Äôs keep making our voices heard until every single family is reunited. 
From mother to activist to candidate - congratulations to @LucyWins2018 on winning the nomination for Congress in #GA06. No one is more determined or resilient, and she will bring an important voice to Congress for the people of Georgia. Onward to November! 
It was wonderful to spend some time with the team from @MadamSecretary on set in Brooklyn with a few former colleagues. Mark your calendars for October 7th! 
Let's help make more of these moments happen. 
My thoughts are with these families and with everyone who is working to reunite them. Special thanks to Paco, Jaime, Juan, Vanessa, and Pamela, DACA recipients who are working hard at reunification sites to help these families get to their next destinations. 
Share stories of the families who are being torn apart by these policies. We all need to be clear as Americans about what's being done in our name, and how we can work together to fix it. 
Follow, help fund, and volunteer for groups that are working on the ground to reunify families, including: @ACLU @CCharitiesUSA @domesticworkers @FWDus @LIRSorg @RAICESTEXAS @TXCivilRights @WomenBelong @WRCommission 
A coalition of groups is raising money for flights, hotels, and cell phones for families traveling to reunite with their loved ones. You can chip in here: 
Thousands of families who have been separated at the border still need to be reunited. In some cases, children have been sent to states far from Texas and Arizona, where their parents were detained. Here‚Äôs how we can help: 
Part of changing our politics means making it possible for more people to be involved. The @CollectivePAC 2018 Black Campaign School is in day two of training future candidates and campaign staffers on everything from field organizing to fundraising. Nice way to spend a Saturday! 
Tune in NOW to watch my panel with @laurenepowell at #ozyfest2018 where we‚Äôll discuss all that‚Äôs happening in the world, why we should all still be optimists, and where we go from here. 
@realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs a clip from when Medvedev was president. Here‚Äôs what I said about Putin‚Äôs Russia. 
To make change this year, don't just vote--volunteer. Commit to taking action in this year's midterms starting now, but especially on #TheLastWeekend when it matters most. 
Ambassador @McFaul is a patriot who has spent his career standing up for America. To see the White House even hesitate to defend a diplomat is deeply troubling. 
Well, now we know. 
Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for? 
About to take the stage at the AFT Convention in Pittsburgh. Tune in! 
Join me at OZY Fest on Saturday, July 21st. I‚Äôll be sitting down in Central Park with @laurenepowell! 
BREAKING: Trump just announced his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Anti-abortion. Anti-healthcare. Thinks Trump is above the law. Here's what you need to know to take action now: #StopKavanaugh 
How many ways can this administration show us they don‚Äôt care about kids? Another example of rejecting science putting corporate interests before babies. These are the stories that will get lost in the shuffle do lasting damage to people everywhere. 
242 years ago, we set out to build a more perfect union. We‚Äôre not finished yet. Happy Fourth of July. 
Meet the first 11 @OnwardTogether partner organizations. I think you‚Äôll find them as inspiring as I do -- and I hope you‚Äôll learn about a group you‚Äôd like to support yourself! 
Nov. 6, 2018. After everything that happened this week, it's the most important day of the year. Get your FREE iVote sticker and put it on your laptop, car, or wherever you can to keep Election Day on everyone's minds. Get yours now: 
Giving a great 4th of July holiday read to a great author friend, Louise Penny! 
Given the news coming out of the Supreme Court this week, I'm excited to support @WeDemandJustice's critical work by welcoming them into the @OnwardTogether family. 
Click here to watch the Facebook LIVE of @HillaryClinton speaking from the @SheldonianOxUni for the 2018 Romanes Lecture: 
Thanks to everyone who gave what they could to make an impact for those children families who need all of our support right now. 
Students, we need your help! Apply today. 
There's nothing American about tearing families apart. We need to elect politicians who will protect the vulnerable. But these kids can't wait for a new Congress in November. Donate today to the organizations leading the fight to protect these kids. 
Thanks to all of you, we have now crossed the $500,000 mark. Here‚Äôs where your generosity is going, let‚Äôs keep it up! @ACLU @asylumadvocacy @FlorenceProject @humanrights1st @supportKIND @LUPE_rgv @RAICESTEXAS @UNITEDWEDREAM @WomenBelong @wrcommission 
Wow. In just the few short hours since I tweeted, this community has donated nearly $150,000 to support these groups‚Äô critical work. If you‚Äôre as heartbroken and infuriated about what‚Äôs happening as I am, help keep it going: 
‚ÄòThis is a moral and humanitarian crisis.‚Äô ‚Äî @HillaryClinton is calling out the Trump administration for detaining immigrant children 
I still believe in the vision we share for our country. We will elect politicians and enact legislation to protect the most vulnerable among us ‚Äì but first, we have to address the urgent needs of families at the center of this crisis. Give today. Please. 
We should be a better country than one that tears families apart, turns a blind eye to women fleeing domestic violence, and treats frightened children as a means to a political end. 
The test of any nation is how we treat the most vulnerable among us. First Lady @LauraWBush made that case eloquently. 
We should be heartbroken to see families torn apart, but we should not be hopeless. There‚Äôs something you can do right now to help. Make a donation that will be split across eight organizations working to protect kids separated from their families: 
Those who selectively use the Bible to justify this cruelty are ignoring a central tenet of Christianity. Jesus said "Suffer the little children unto me." He did not say ‚Äúlet the children suffer.‚Äù 
Despite what this White House claims, separating families is not mandated by law. That is an outright lie, and it‚Äôs incumbent on all of us ‚Äì journalists and citizens alike ‚Äì to call it just that. 
What‚Äôs happening to families at the border right now is a humanitarian crisis. Every parent who has ever held a child in their arms, every human being with a sense of compassion and decency, should be outraged. 
UPDATE: 43 senators now support our bill to bar children from being taken from their parents at the border. We still need a Republican senator to join. If you‚Äôre represented by a Republican senator, please ask them to cosponsor S.3036. #FamiliesBelongTogether 
Last night I met Ke‚ÄôShon, Liv Kayla. Their stories about the impact of gun violence in this film by @GiffordsCourage are heart-wrenching. I'm so proud of them for showing the strength we need to fight for a safer future. Watch it and join them here: 
So thrilled to be with @GabbyGiffords, @ShuttleCDRKelly, so many others tonight at the 25th anniversary celebration of the Giffords Law Center. Tune in now. 
But my emails. 
The choice is ours, will we show up at the polls and demand respect and dignity for our community or will we be complacent? We're fighting back! Join our #SomosMas campaign to register 1 million voters by 2020 by texting SOMOS to 73179. 
Here we go again. The Trump Admin is trying to take away your health care by ending protections for ppl w/ pre-existing conditions. It will hurt millions of Americans. Spread the word. Call your Congress member tell them to stand up for you: 202-224-3121 
Women‚Äôs rights are human rights Women‚Äôs rights are human rights Women‚Äôs rights are human rights Women‚Äôs rights are human rights Women‚Äôs rights are human rights Women‚Äôs rights are human rights Women‚Äôs rights are human rights #SupportERA RT if you agree 
Thank you to @Realdavidcbanks, his team at @EAFNYC, and all the stakeholders that joined us for a terrific meeting this afternoon about expanding Eagle Academy‚Äôs pioneering work in public education. 
If you want to read some good news today, my friend David Banks and I published an op ed in the @NYDailyNews about how the Eagle Academy schools are transforming lives in New York and elsewhere. Check it out: 
There is no more important test of our country than the way we treat the most vulnerable among us, especially children. We cannot turn away from what‚Äôs happening on our watch - we have to act. 
If you‚Äôre like me, there‚Äôs nothing worse than feeling helpless. So on this National Day of Action for Children (supported by groups from @ACLU to @WomenBelong to @UnitedWeDream to @MomsRising, @DomesticWorkers), visit to see what you can do to help. 
It is now the official policy of the US government - a nation of immigrants - to separate children from their families. That is an absolute disgrace. #FamiliesBelongTogether. 
He said that ‚ÄúIn the immigration context, the government has never taken a stand against the protection of kids in this country. For the first time, it is now formally taking a position that explicitly goes against the best interests of kids.‚Äù 
Muzaffar Chishti of @MigrationPolicy said something that has stuck with me. 
Not only that - this administration built on their "zero tolerance" policy earlier this month. The result? Nearly 700 more kids were separated from their families in the first two weeks of the new program. Think about that. Hundreds of families torn apart in two weeks. 
We now know that more than 700 kids were separated from their parents between October 2017 and April 2018. As a mother and a grandmother, it‚Äôs devastating to even imagine. 
Like so many others, I am horrified and heartbroken by what is happening to immigrant kids and families because of this administration‚Äôs disastrous policies. 
Too many American children will never have the opportunity to realize their dreams because their lives were cut short by a bullet. Our kids deserve to live free from the threat of gun violence. #WearOrange @Everytown @MomsDemand 
More than 4,600 lives lost in Puerto Rico. 70x the official number. The US gov‚Äôt has failed its own citizens. The response itself is an American tragedy. Hurricane season is about to begin in Puerto Rico. The administration must step up protect its people. 
.@EmergeAmerica is working hard to make sure we‚Äôll always have qualified Democratic women on the ballot. I‚Äôm thrilled they‚Äôre bringing this important work to Arkansas, a state near and dear to my heart, with the launch of their 25th state affiliate. 
Virginia just became the 33rd state to pass Medicaid expansion. 400,000 lives will be improved by giving people access to health insurance. Bold ideas matter. Democratic values matter. Elections matter. 
Just returned from marching in the annual Chappaqua Memorial Day Parade with everyone from Governors to Girls Scouts. Today we honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country to keep us safe here at home. 
Bill tried his hand at mystery writing and it paid off. The President is Missing, co-authored by James Patterson, is getting rave reviews! 
Up in Boston today for #RadDay18 where I‚Äôll be talking to @maura_healey, Massachusetts‚Äô great Attorney General. Tune in! 
Everyone has the power to make a difference in this year‚Äôs elections by volunteering. This new training resource from @swingleft makes it incredibly easy. Check it out. 
Just spent a great evening with two of my favorite authors discussing their new book, The President is Missing. It‚Äôs a page-turner! Check it out: 
@SenEvanBayh To Evan, Susan, and the whole family, we are thinking about you and praying for you. If anyone can take on this fight it‚Äôs Susan Bayh, with the strength, courage, and grace she brings to everything she does. 
Lucy, you took your unspeakable tragedy and helped propel an inspiring movement for gun safety in America. Thank you for your leadership on this and so much more. 
Thrilled to be back @Yale speaking at Class Day. Tune in now! 
Every day that we fail to act on gun violence, we are failing our children. This should be a day for soul searching across America - and that soul searching should be matched with legislating to begin dealing with this national shame. 
Our @OnwardTogether partner organization @latinovictoryus has a plan to resist Trump‚Äôs agenda by electing more Latinos. Watch: 
The GOP wants to break their bipartisan pledge cut funding for the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program to pay for their tax cuts to the wealthy corporations. We must take care of our children. Experts doctors agree. Lots of them: 
So exciting! 
It will also be harder to deal with other threats like ballistic missiles and terrorism. Now we have no leverage and Iran is free to do what it wants. Read what President Obama wrote about it here: 
As Secretary of State, I helped negotiate the crippling international sanctions that brought Iran to the table. It would be much harder a second time, now that our credibility is shot. 
Pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal is a big mistake. It makes America less safe and less trusted. Iran is now more dangerous. What's plan B? Anyone who thinks bombing is the answer is woefully misinformed. 
Great piece about a great guy I‚Äôve known for a long time. 
I‚Äôve known @TomDangora and @AnastasiaSomoza for years they bring compassion creativity to everything they do. They have created the first family musical about disability need help fundraising. Check out @AddyandUno below support them with me. 
Thank you @CecileRichards for your extraordinary leadership over the last 12 years as president of Planned Parenthood - and for getting up every single day to fight for a world where women's rights truly are human rights. #ThankYouCecile 
See you soon @alliance4youth @arenasummit @CollectivePac @ColorOfChange @EmergeAmerica @IndivisibleTeam @iVoteFund @latinovictoryus @runforsomething @swingleft @votolatino! 
Heading into NYC for @OnwardTogether‚Äôs first annual Partners Collaborative to discuss how we can work together to defend our progressive values. 
Thank YOU for leading the way on this issue. 
Can you imagine how different our policies would be if more working moms and dads were part of making them? That's why I'm calling on the FEC to allow candidates to use campaign funds for childcare when they‚Äôre on the trail. 
Raise your hand if you like infrastructure conferences! (ü§ö). I‚Äôll be speaking at the @RegionalPlan Assembly about the future of American infrastructure. Tune in at 1:25! 
New York State expanded #TakeOurChildrenToWorkDay today with a great initiative for foster kids. It‚Äôs a chance to let their imaginations run wild w/ possibilities see some of New York State‚Äôs great companies. I hope we'll see this elsewhere in NY across the US. #seeitbeit 
Alright, I decided to start a @gofundme for James Shaw Jr, the Waffle House hero. I normally hate when people say this, but in this case, I think its important...please RT. Link To Donate: 
I talk a lot about reading, singing, talking to your children so they have the tools they need when they enter school. @bethkobliner takes the next step, teaming up with the great Kate McKinnon to teach kids financial literacy. It‚Äôs fun, check it out! 
He may not remember, but I‚Äôll never forget that day or the years after working as Senator to keep NY safe and helping our First Responders. 
Thinking about Barbara Bush‚Äôs legacy of service to our country and the extraordinary family she raised. Thanking her for her many kindnesses to me and my family. Wishing her the comfort she deserves surrounded by her loved ones. 
More terrific work from a group of progressives working to turn activism into lasting action. Congratulations to @arenasummit on announcing their latest class of fellows today. #OnwardTogether 
Storytelling is at the heart of every cultural political revolution. Looking forward to joining @WomenintheWorld tomorrow w/ 4 brave women who will share accounts of living under tyrants discuss threats to democracies around the world at home. #WITW 
Congratulations Tammy! 
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr was in Memphis in 1968 to protest with sanitation workers the week he was killed. Here‚Äôs the story of one of those workers, Cleophus Smith, who is still on the job today. 
Thanks for the warm welcome last night! Inspired by your passion and commitment. 
Wishing @JuliaGillard, Former Aussie PM, the best for today‚Äôs launch of her new Global Institute for Women‚Äôs Leadership, based at King‚Äôs College London. @GIWLkings will help create a world in which being a woman is not a barrier to becoming a leader. #womensleadership 
A little over 15 years ago a bright young woman walked into my office in the Senate and I hired her to be my scheduler. Yesterday @LValmoro was asked back to her alma mater to introduce me to stage. A proud moment for a grateful boss. 
We are indeed on the brink. Thank you to Rutgers for having me yesterday, and to all the students and community members who came out to have such a thoughtful conversation. 
Listening to the students from Parkland and across the country today is a reminder of what is possible when our future is in the right hands, and when we match inspiration with determination. 
My friend @jmpalmieri wrote a terrific book that everyone should read. It‚Äôs smart, emotional, and true. See for yourself in this excerpt: 
Important analysis about which candidates get critical early financial support ‚Äî and which don't. 
Congresswoman Louise Slaughter was a tireless advocate for her constituents in New York. She showed me the ropes when I was first elected to the Senate in 2000, did the same for so many of our colleagues. I was lucky to call her a friend. She will be missed. 
To all the students across our country who took part in #NationalWalkoutDay: Never let anybody tell you your voices don‚Äôt make a difference. You‚Äòre an inspiration to millions of Americans who know commonsense gun reform is long overdue. We are with you, and we will not give up. 
@timkaine I‚Äôm forever grateful to you for being such an outspoken champion and advocate for women. Having allies like you on our side means the world - today and every day. 
Who inspires you this #InternationalWomensDay?

@Astrid_NV @iammarleydias @aijenpoo @domesticworkers @reshmasaujani @ColleenFlangan My friends @SybrinaFulton, @GwenCarrERIC, @MariaHa05153239, @lucymcbath, @iammikesmother, Geneva Reed-Veal, Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, and Annette Nance-Holt have turned their mourning into a movement, fighting for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice. 
@Astrid_NV @iammarleydias @aijenpoo @domesticworkers @reshmasaujani @ColleenFlangan advocates for health care and Americans with disabilities‚Äîabsolutely refusing to be ignored. 
@Astrid_NV @iammarleydias @aijenpoo @domesticworkers @reshmasaujani The US women‚Äôs hockey and soccer teams stood up for themselves and all women in sports by demanding pay equity and fair treatment.

The courageous @Astrid_NV fights tirelessly to protect DREAMers and keep immigrant families together. 
In honor of #InternationalWomensDay, I want to celebrate some of the women and girls who inspire me every day. These women resist inequality, insist on a better world, persist against all odds, and enlist others in our shared fights. 
Saw Black Panther with Bill this afternoon loved it. Beautiful film, lots of action, and a great message. Don't miss it! 
Outdoor retailer REI says it‚Äôs halting future orders of some popular brands ‚Äî including CamelBak water carriers, Giro helmets and Camp Chef stoves ‚Äî whose parent company also makes ammunition and assault-style rifles. 
College students--you have the power to take back a Democratic majority in the House. Deadline is today! Apply now: 
I say this as a former Secretary of State and as an American: the Russians are still coming. Our intelligence professionals are imploring Trump to act. Will he continue to ignore surrender, or protect our country? 
I‚Äôm so excited! ü§ó 
PLEASE PRE-REGISTER TO VOTE IF YOUR STATE ALLOWS! TO MY GENERATION: WE MUST VOTE OUT THE PEOPLE WHO VALUE DOLLARS OVER LIVES! 
We should all care about how social media platforms play a part in our democratic process. Because unless it‚Äôs addressed it will happen again. The midterms are in 8 months. We owe it to our democracy to get this right, and fast. 
Women‚Äôs rights are human rights. That was a radical idea back in 1995. It shouldn‚Äôt still be two decades later. 
Parkland students, you have shown so much courage in standing up for truth, for your right to attend school safely, now against these disgusting smears. The good news is, it will only make you louder stronger. 
Another terrific organization Onward Together is working with to make change! 
Want to hear the real story of the @ClintonFdn? Read this: 
Here‚Äôs the speech from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Emma Gonzalez at an anti-gun rally happening today in Fort Lauderdale // 
Mass shootings are not inevitable. The majority of Americans support common sense gun reform. Though we feel angry, heartbroken, even helpless now, we have the power to elect people who will protect lives, not gun sellers‚Äô profits. Remember these feelings in November, and VOTE. 
And to this young woman. Every day that we refuse to act, we are failing them. 
We owe it to this young man who lost classmates: 
Now is the time to listen to the students, teachers, and parents demanding that we end this carnage once and for all with gun safety laws that keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn‚Äôt have them. 
This week we lost 17 Americans in Parkland - the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook in 2012. Since then, 438 people have been shot and 138 killed in over 230 school shootings. That‚Äôs 5 school shootings every month, 16 of which classify as ‚Äúmass shootings.‚Äù 
41 years ago @HillaryClinton helped found @AACF to help children and families have the resources and opportunities to live better lives. Hillary always pushed me to live my best life, and it‚Äôs in that spirit that I couldn‚Äôt be prouder to join their board.

I wrote a Facebook post about a decision I made 10 years ago, what‚Äôs changed, on an issue you didn‚Äôt hear a single word about tonight. Take a look. 
I called her today to tell her how proud I am of her and to make sure she knows what all women should: we deserve to be heard. 
A story appeared today about something that happened in 2008. I was dismayed when it occurred, but was heartened the young woman came forward, was heard, and had her concerns taken seriously and addressed. 
Thank you, @CecileRichards, for your tireless advocacy on behalf of women and girls, and for your grace under pressure over these last 12 years. And thank you to @PPFA for all you‚Äôve done and continue to do to advance reproductive rights. Onward! 
For those of you who don‚Äôt know @aminatou, she‚Äôs a supremely talented young woman with a terrific podcast, @callyrgf. She is also courageously gracefully managing a cancer diagnosis. Amina, sending you good vibes post-surgery sharing your inspiring thread. 
In 2017, the Women‚Äôs March was a beacon of hope and defiance. In 2018, it is a testament to the power and resilience of women everywhere. Let‚Äôs show that same power in the voting booth this year. #PowerToThePolls 
Reps. John Lewis, Bennie Thompson to Attend Grand Celebration of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum 
I‚Äôm so heartened by all of you. Onward! 
These words from Dr. King also come to mind today: 
Beautifully said, @BerniceKing. An important message today and every day. 
The anniversary of the devastating earthquake 8 years ago is a day to remember the tragedy, honor the resilient people of Haiti, affirm America‚Äôs commitment to helping our neighbors. Instead, we‚Äòre subjected to Trump‚Äôs ignorant, racist views of anyone who doesn‚Äôt look like him. 
@NancyEMcFadden Nancy has a record of beating the odds - from DC to CA - where she helped Gov Brown do a fantastic job. All who know her are sending strength love as she faces this latest challenge. Onward my friend. -H 
Two weeks ago a 26-year old soldier raced repeatedly into a burning Bronx apartment building, saving four people before he died in the flames. His name was Pvt. Emmanuel Mensah and he immigrated from Ghana, a country Donald Trump apparently thinks produces very subpar immigrants. 
Today, the amazing @SusanBordo's THE DESTRUCTION OF HILLARY CLINTON is out in paperback! We're celebrating with this excerpt. Pulling punches isn't exactly Susan's thing ‚Äî thank goodness. 
Families across America had to start 2018 worried that their kids wouldn‚Äôt have health care. Failing to act now shows the true face of Republicans their donor-driven immoral agenda. You control the Senate agenda @SenateMajLdr. Enough is enough. 
Time to bring CHIP to the Senate floor as promised. This alleged extension until March doesn‚Äôt cut it as states freeze enrollment send out letters warning that coverage will end. This is frightening to parents wreaks havoc for states. 
The Iranian people, especially the young, are protesting for the freedom and future they deserve. I hope their government responds peacefully and supports their hopes. 
Retweet if you agree it‚Äôs totally crazy to suggest that the FBI ‚Äî having helped sink Hillary‚Äôs campaign by revealing that she was under investigation while concealing that Trump was being investigated ‚Äî has secretly been anti-Trump all along.

Thank you to everyone who has donated to Onward Together in our first year -- we‚Äôre only able to support these great groups because of you. Let‚Äôs do even more in 2018. Onward! 
Along with @IndivisibleTeam, @ColorOfChange, @EmergeAmerica, @swingleft, and @runforsomething, I know these groups will continue to do the incredible work of making our democracy stronger in 2018, and I'm proud to be on their team. 
And with the help of @collectivepac, 23 African-American candidates have been elected to local, state, and federal offices since August 2016. 
More than 400 students and leaders met last month at the @votolatino Power Summit to share resources and tools for national advocacy. 
The team at @latinovictoryus is working to elect more Latino candidates at every level of government. 
At @alliance4youth, young people are using local organizing to address economic inequality, attacks on voting rights, and more. 
At @alliance4youth, young people are using local organizing to address economic inequality, attacks on voting rights, and more. 
450 brand-new civic leaders and activists attended the very first @ArenaSummit -- and they're on track to train 5,000 people by the end of 2018. 
The organizers at @iVoteFund worked with partners on the ground to get automatic voter registration on the ballot in Nevada. 
Onward Together is ending 2017 by supporting six more incredible organizations fighting to protect voting rights and to make it easier for young, diverse candidates to get on the ballot and get elected.

Something productive to do with your outrage today: 
I guest-edited this month‚Äôs issue of @TeenVogue. It was a wonderful experience, with lots of terrific contributions from people I love respect. Read this letter that my daughter wrote to her children about why she‚Äôs still optimistic about the future. cc: @ChelseaClinton 
A little girl power in Pasadena... 
Some photos from the book tour. I met so many incredible people, including some little heros, the occasional superhero... 
Returning home after the final week of the book tour for 2017. This was the last copy of What Happened I signed at our final signing in Seattle. What a terrific journey this has been so far, thank you to all who came out told me your stories. 
Thank you to the @lapromisefund @msjwilly for a terrific discussion, a wonderful group of young people, a truly inspiring day! 
Today is the final day to sign up for 2018 health coverage. Go to and get covered! 
@ELaffGarb @DHochsprung @ELaffGarb, thinking of you, @nelba_MG, and all the Sandy Hook families this week. Thank you for your courage. 
Yes! Elections matter. 
Tonight, Alabama voters elected a senator who'll make them proud. And if Democrats can win in Alabama, we can -- and must -- compete everywhere. Onward! 
Mayor Ed Lee‚Äôs death is a terrible loss for the people of San Francisco. He was a good friend a vocal advocate for the city he served loved. My thoughts are with his family. 
If you don't live in an area that could be affected, read this to see how you can help those who do: 
Thinking about all affected those who could be affected by the California wildfires. If you live near a fire, make sure you're prepared, stay safe. 
I‚Äôm going to keep tweeting about this, and speaking out every chance I get, until it is fixed. 
So in these surreal times, let‚Äôs rally together take action. Call your House and Senate members at 202-224-3121 and tell them to take care of kids now and protect our seniors, the poor vulnerable from future attacks. Tell them that it‚Äôs the very least they can do. 
How is it that in the middle of dividing up $1.5 trillion dollars between corporations the ultra-wealthy, Republicans can‚Äôt find the time money to take care of children? These are perverse priorities. Congress needs to pass CHIP now, as they have every year since the 1990s. 
It gets worse. During the campaign I warned that the Rs would come after social security, Medicare, Medicaid now they are. Imagine buying a Rolex paying for it with money you saved to take care of your kids. That‚Äôs what Congress is doing w/ your tax dollars. 
Meanwhile, Senate Republicans rushed to pass so-called tax reform - a giveaway for those who least need it. 
The Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health care for 9 million kids has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis every year for almost 2 decades, is hanging in limbo because Congress let it expire over 2 months ago. 
There‚Äôs a lot to be frustrated by right now, to say the least. Here‚Äôs something that we should be able to fix. 
97 years of a passionate, independent spirit, a fierce commitment to Democratic values. Mary Louise Hancock will be missed by many, including me. 
Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know what to do after a loss. Not this time. This tax bill is only going to get worse as people learn more about it. There are 6 GOP Senators that have to run on it 2 open seats in 2018. We all need to get to work. 
Sign up before midnight TONIGHT! 
It's #GivingTuesday! With your donation of $25 or more to Swing Left, take your pick of one of our brand-new holiday cards‚Äîperfect for sharing the season's greetings with your favorite progressive.

You go girl! This is important; costs will go up, powerful companies will get more powerful. We can‚Äôt let it slip through the cracks. 
And on top of that, you can‚Äôt beat a little book signing wardrobe fun. 
And being out on the book tour it has been wonderful to hear from so many people about their activism, their courage, their resilience. 
Wow. I wasn‚Äôt sure how letting my guard down would go...but it‚Äôs been cathartic rewarding. I loved writing this book, I‚Äôm honored to be in such great company on this list! 
It‚Äôs been almost 2 months since Congress let the program that provides health care for 9 million children expire. Call Congress tell them to reauthorize CHIP now: 202-224-3121 
Tonight, @HillaryClinton and I will join our friend @JamesCarville for a look back at the '92 campaign‚Äî25 years later!‚Äîand talk about the ideals that inspired us all to enter public service. Hope you'll tune in: 
The House just passed a massive tax cut for the wealthy, and Republicans want to pay for it by taking apart Obamacare. Let‚Äôs make them regret voting for this Trump Tax Scam. Donate to vote them out: 
It‚Äôs true! I want to join your book club to talk about What Happened what‚Äôs happening...sign up! 
@BenSPLATT @DearEvanHansen Two friends on a perfect day. Sincerely, me. 
Good. 
Being your candidate was the honor of a lifetime. Now it's your turn to #runforsomething: 
Looking forward to a great discussion with my friend Dorothy and to a great day @UVA! Tune in: 
Join me live this morning at 9:45am for an important discussion about child adolescent mental health, focused on solutions for families communities. #ChildMindSummit 
Proud of you, Becca! 
It was a thrill to work on this project with @ElaineWelteroth. I‚Äôm really proud of the result. I hope you enjoy it. 
Thanks to everyone at @GWRodham for a great discussion last week, and for advocating for stronger communities with better health outcomes. 
Thank you to all who have worn our country's uniform, and the families who serve with them. Happy Veterans Day. 
Everyone deserves affordable health insurance. Head over to and shop for a plan that's right for you. 
Grateful to you and your determined husband. Like I say in my book, I would have worked so hard to help, had specific ideas to do just that. 
I‚Äôve thought a lot about the church massacre last Sunday. What can anyone say equal to the horror grief? We should act to prevent future killings by expanding fully funding background checks. 94% of Americans support them, it should be the law. 
Better believe it. And @billclinton has been tirelessly working on this issue through the @ClintonFdn: 
Love this. What a great way to spend November 8th‚Äîor any day, for that matter! 
As we celebrate, let‚Äôs also remember the work ahead. Proud that groups that Onward Together supports‚Äîincluding @SwingLeft, which is laser-focused on taking back the House‚Äîhave been making incredible progress in the fight for 2018 and beyond. Onward! 
So many groups own a piece of last night's victory, from @theDemocrats to @EMILYsList to @TheDLCC. It's remarkable to watch our Democratic family‚Äîgroups with decades of victories and those born in the aftermath of the last election‚Äîteam up to make nights like last night possible. 
And the important work done by @ColorofChange‚Äôs PAC was instrumental in winning the district attorney race in Philadelphia. 
Our friends at @IndivisibleTeam report that their local groups made more than 600,000 calls into the Commonwealth to help elect @RalphNortham @FairfaxJustin @MarkHerringVA. 
.@EmergeAmerica-trained candidates won all across the country, including 9 of the seats Democrats won in Virginia's House of Delegates. 
They tell me about 10% of first-time candidates usually win, but 40% of @runforsomething candidates came out on top yesterday. 
Congratulations to @RunforSomething founders @amandalitman + @RossMoRock for a huge night! 25 of the local candidates they helped to recruit and run won. 
Last night was a great reminder of what‚Äôs possible when we come together and fight for what we believe in. So I wanted to take a few minutes to celebrate the extraordinary successes of a few groups I‚Äîand Onward Together‚Äîproudly fight alongside. 
And if you live in New York state like I do, there are a lot of important races today, so go out and vote‚ÄîI did! 
New Jersey: you have the chance to elect @PhilMurphyNJ @SheilaOliverNJ and other great Dems today. Take it! 
Virginians: my friends @RalphNortham @FairfaxJustin @MarkHerringVA need you to show up and vote to get across the finish line. 
You can confirm where to vote here: 
Live in VA, NJ, WA, NY or anywhere with an election today? Consider this my personal ask/nudge/plea for you to go to the polls and VOTE. 
Be Resilient. 
Today marks the start of open enrollment for 2018 health coverage. Go to to find your perfect plan. #GetCoveredNow 
New York's resilience is stronger than a cowardly act of terror. Thinking of the victims, their families, the responders who saved lives. 
No one I would rather share initials with than @HRC. 
Oh is that today? 
Children are going to lose their health care. No one should want that. Call your member of Congress and tell them to act: 202-224-3121

Gabby and Mark are right: ‚ÄúAmerica is facing a serious but totally preventable epidemic of gun violence.‚Äù Join me in supporting them. 
This is a disgrace. American citizens need America‚Äôs resources. Now. 
Statement from Secretary Clinton on Harvey Weinstein: 
Call Congress @ (202) 224-3121. Tell them we must work together to get this done for the children families counting on CHIP. 7/7 
Grateful to the Senate Finance Committee for passing a strong and much needed bipartisan reauthorization bill. Now, let's get this done. 6/7 
The test of any society is how it treats its children. We cannot allow millions of kids to lose access to basic health care. 5/7 
Right now, many states are getting ready to send out notices to parents, letting them know that their kids‚Äô coverage is in jeopardy. 4/7 
There are so many stories of young people whose lives have been transformed by CHIP. Sara's is one: 3/7 
Back in the '90s, Democrats and Republicans worked together to pass CHIP. Today, it covers 9 million kids. 2/7 
This hasn't gotten enough attn: For the first time, Congress missed the deadline to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. 1/7 
Thanks to @parentsmagazine for a great chat about what it was like to work on It Takes A Village with @MarlaFrazee. 
Rolling back no-copay birth control shows a blatant disregard for medicine, science, every woman's right to make her own health decisions. 
Couldn't have put it better! Proud to have contributed to this book about how to @runforsomething. 
As the world sees the worst of us this tribute to Anita Datar who died as the best of America reminds us who we are. 
Taking the stage at Stanford to talk about threats to western democracy - and what we can do about them. Tune in! 
Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again. 
The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get. 
Las Vegas, we are grieving with you‚Äîthe victims, those who lost loved ones, the responders, all affected by this cold-blooded massacre. 
Don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel alone. We are with you and Puerto Rico. 
You can tell a lot about a society by how we treat the most vulnerable. What does it say when kids' health takes a backseat to tax reform? 
@OfficialJLD Julia, you're in our thoughts and our hearts. Inspired but not surprised to see you using your platform for good in this difficult moment. 
Great to be back in Brooklyn sharing #ItTakesAVillage with readers of all ages! 
It's about time. Ladies, start your engines! 
When people ask me what we should do now, my answer is clear: The most important thing you can do is vote in every election. 
President Trump, Sec. Mattis, and DOD should send the Navy, including the USNS Comfort, to Puerto Rico now. These are American citizens. 
This video from my local bookstore @scatteredbooks in Chappaqua put a smile on my face! Love the soundtrack, too. 
Our friends at @IndivisibleTeam explain what's happening and what you can do (need to do!) to stop it. 
If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
Nothing is more important than saving the Affordable Care Act from another cruel effort to take health care away from millions of people. 
The perfect book for teaching young kids ‚Äì or, you know, the president ‚Äì how to make the world a better place. 
@realDonaldTrump If you didn't like that book, try this one ‚Äî some good lessons in here about working together to solve problems. Happy to send a copy. 
Edie Windsor showed the world that love can be a powerful force for change. She will be greatly missed.

Hillary Clinton Reveals How You Can Make A Difference In The Fight Against Trump cc: @HillaryClinton 
So many great organizations are helping. Our family has donated to three of them: @TeamRubicon, @DirectRelief, and @TXDIAPERBANK. 
Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of the people affected by Hurricane Harvey and with those helping them. 
.@HillaryClinton is hitting the road to talk about her new book 
As we keep everyone affected by Hurricane Harvey in our thoughts, here‚Äôs how you can help: 
Correct. 
‚ÄúWriting ‚ÄòWhat Happened‚Äô was hard, so is what we see every day. I hope this helps.‚Äù ‚Äì @HillaryClinton 
Thinking of those who put their lives on the line to defend America. Let's keep these missing sailors in our thoughts prayers today. 
Barcelona, you have our resolve and support in the face of this cowardly attack. We stand together against terrorism wherever it strikes. 
This is an important step, thanks to @ColorofChange for helping to make it happen. 
There's no place in Virginia for hatred bigotry. People who've come to VA today to hurt others are not patriots, they are cowards. Go home 
We will not step backward. If this is not who we are as Americans, let's prove it. 
Now is the time for leaders to be strong in their words deliberate in their actions. 
Every minute we allow this to persist through tacit encouragement or inaction is a disgrace, corrosive to our values. 
But the incitement of hatred that got us here is as real and condemnable as the white supremacists in our streets. 
My heart is in Charlottesville today, and with everyone made to feel unsafe in their country. 
@EricBoehlert Right here: 
America's workers need #paidleave so we can all provide and receive critical care. #TimeToCare #FMLA24 
Not even bound yet and making me cry. The honor was all ours, @HillaryClinton. 
Writing ‚ÄúWhat Happened‚Äù was hard, so is what we see every day. As we move forward fight back, I hope this helps. 
Exclusive: Hillary Clinton is releasing a tell-all book about the election called 'What Happened' 
John McCain is as tough as they come. Thinking of John, Cindy, their wonderful children, their whole family tonight. 
Support Samantha Bee Planned Parenthood buy a Nasty Woman t-shirt!

@emilyslist Their determination passion is truly inspiring. And I can't wait to see what this new generation of women leaders accomplishes. Onward! 
@emilyslist Today, @emilyslist announced that 15,000+ women have reached out since Election Day about running for office! 7,000+ want to help them run. 
For more than 30 years, @emilyslist has paved the way for women to run succeed in elected office, including me. 
Happy #Pride2017 to everyone in NYC across the globe. Never forget that LGBT rights are human rights human rights are LGBT rights. 
Forget death panels. If Republicans pass this bill, they're the death party. 
.@BarackObama is right. This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics. Speak out against this bill. 
When you talk about "cuts to Medicaid" just remember you're talking about a lot of kids. It is cruel. 
If you're waiting for the right moment to call your Senator about Trumpcare, the moment is now. Don't wait until it's too late. 202-224-3121 
Best of luck to the Member Team the Press Team tonight at the @CWSoftballGame, which raises money for young women with cancer. #CWSG 
Let's all keep the brave sailors of the USS Fitzgerald in our thoughts prayers this weekend. 
Still no bill. Call the Senate switchboard ask for your Senator. Tell them this bill will hurt people you know love. (202) 224-3121 
2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we're all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff heroic police. 
This is so dang cool we are doing back flips! =D @WonderWomanFilm @PattyJenks #WonderWoman #WomenKickAss 
Americans deserve to know what's in the GOP health care plan. Hold hearings be accountable to your constituents. That's democracy. 
My heart is with the loved ones of the 49 people killed at Pulse, the city of Orlando, the LGBT community. #WeWillNotLetHateWin

People across America have made their voices heard thanks to @IndivisibleTeam, and supported @swingleft's efforts to take back the House. 
More than ever, I believe citizen engagement is vital to our democracy. I'm so inspired by everyone stepping up to organize and lead. 
We're launching Onward Together to encourage people to get involved, organize, and even run for office. 
The last few months, I've been reflecting, spending time with family‚Äîand, yes, taking walks in the woods. 
Victory for Macron, for France, the EU, the world. Defeat to those interfering w/democracy. (But the media says I can't talk about that) 
A shameful failure of policy morality by GOP today. Fight back on behalf of the millions of families that will be hurt by their actions: 
Watch prepare to tear up. Thanks @jimmykimmel for sharing your story reminding us what's at stake w/health care. 
Great to see ppl take to the streets combat climate change, protect the next generation fight for jobs economic justice. #climatemarch

These are more than statistics, they‚Äôre American lives at risk because this administration willfully ignores the science. 
Preach @HillaryClinton!!! @MissBeaE @MaxineWaters @yashar 
And while we have your attention from recycled, false claims, here are some facts about how @ClintonFdn has improved lives around the world: 
Let‚Äôs not be distracted. Let‚Äôs continue to stand up, organize, resist, put forth good ideas to improve the existing system peoples' lives. 
Ryan, who was born with a disability and with the support of his family and world-class health care has had a lifetime of opportunities. 
Pam, who is raising her grandson because his parents are struggling with opioid addiction - a silent epidemic in so many communities. 
Angelina, a young woman with autism who is already worrying who will take care of her when her parents are gone. 
50 years with the love of my life. 
Very pleased that Russia has released the two Church volunteers and that they are now returning home to their families. 
I can‚Äôt understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God. 
Deeply saddened by the terrorist attacks at the mosques in New Zealand‚Äîpure evil. We must reject hatred, in our own country and across the globe. Praying for the 49 innocent people who lost their lives and their families, as well as those who were injured. 
The President made the right decision to ground the 737 MAX. This is a commonsense step until the causes of the recent crashes have been investigated and pilots‚Äô concerns have been addressed to ensure safety. 
@AnnRomney Thank you, sweetheart! 
Out of an abundance of caution for the flying public, the @FAANews should ground the 737 MAX 8 until we investigate the causes of recent crashes and ensure the plane‚Äôs airworthiness. 
My team surprised me with a cake made out of my favorite snack‚Äîtwinkies! Looking forward to all this year has in store. 
China invests in Italy‚Äôs factories, buildings, and culture: welcome news. China wants to invest in your PORTS, however, don‚Äôt be fooled: They are looking for a stranglehold. 
Tonight, Senate Democrats blocked a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It‚Äôs unconscionable inhumane that some in our country, especially members of Congress, are unwilling to take a stand and support the lives of newborns who survive an abortion attempt. 
The beauty of our state is unmatched‚Äîlooking out over Eagle Canyon. 
I am concerned that the Administration has yet to comply with the law, nor has it sufficiently explained why. As has been requested by members of both parties, I urge the Administration to rectify this urgent situation and brief Congress on its progress as soon as possible. 
The question that Congress wants answered is whether any senior Saudi officials, including members of the Saudi royal family, were responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. By law, the President is required to report to Congress on these findings imposition of sanctions. 
Even more smitten now than I was back then. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. 
Here's to hoping Tom Brady gets to lift his 6th Lombardi tonight. Let's go Pats! 
Russia has continued its bad behavior by deploying prohibited weapons systems in blatant violation of the INF treaty. We cannot wish our way to deterrence, and withdrawing from the INF‚Äîwith the full support of our NATO allies‚Äîis the right policy. 
.@POTUS has put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border. I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same. 
All human life is sacred and those who #MarchForLife today march in the spirit of compassion and mercy. I share their commitment to laws that protect the innocent and will continue defending the dignity of life. 
Heartbroken with the tragic passing of Officer Joseph Shinners last night in the line duty‚Äîa loving husband and new father. Ann and I extend our deepest condolences to Officer Shinners' family, friends, and fellow @ProvoPolice officers. God bless our men and women in uniform. 
Rep. Tlaib took the politics of Washington deeper down the drain. Elected leaders should elevate, not degrade, our public discourse. 
Happy birthday to the beautiful state of Utah! 
With deep appreciation. 
Used my dad‚Äôs Bible for today‚Äôs swearing-in. He inscribed a message in it each time he took the oath of office, and I did the same today. It‚Äôs an honor to serve. 
To the people of Utah: Thank you for entrusting me with the responsibility of serving you in the United States Senate. 
Excited for this next chapter. Let's do this. 
Policies and appointments are only a part of a presidency. A president must also unite us, inspire us, and defend our vital institutions. 
As my Church moves from three hour Sunday services to two hours, best choice for first hymn of the New Year: No. 19. 
Wishing you love and laughter. Merry Christmas! 
The foreign policy described by Gen. Mattis today has, for nearly 3/4 century, kept us from global war, empowered our economy, helped billions escape from poverty opened freedom‚Äôs door around the world. His service, vision character were a blessing. He will be greatly missed. 
SLC 2030 is the right choice. Utah is ready, willing and more than able to once again host the world and its extraordinary athletes. Congrats to the Utah team that won this honor to represent the USA. 
In his farewell Senate speech, Senator Hatch charged his colleagues to foster greater mutual respect, pluralism, dignity, comity and unity. His record of legislative accomplishment is unparalleled; his call for greatness is characteristic of this man of vision. 
Ann and I join the nation in mourning his passing and in celebrating the greatness of his character that we were privileged to witness. 5/5 
We have ridden alongside him as he spirited his boat in Maine. We marveled at the grace he showed to everyone who he encountered. He was a man in full; being with him brought a fuller measure of life to each of us. 4/5 
Ann I have been enormously blessed by President Bush‚Äôs counsel, generosity friendship. We have laughed together at his Barbara‚Äôs table discussed the course of the nation at his library. Every encounter with George H.W. Bush impressed us with both his wisdom his wit. 3/5 
His resolve helped bring down the Soviet Union, his compassion brightened thousands of points of light, his parenting raised a noble family, and his character inspired a generation. We mourn the loss of a great one. 2/5 
No one stood taller than George H.W. Bush, a giant among men. Hero in war, servant in the halls of state, and President of the greatest nation on earth. 1/5 
Thankful for Ann, the boys, their wives, their children; thankful for faith, for freedom, for friendship; thankful for parents, ancestors, pioneers, patriots, founding fathers, heroes proved in liberating strife. Thank you God, the Father of All. 
My thoughts on the President‚Äôs and Secretary of State‚Äôs statements on Khashoggi. 
Welcome home, Maj. Taylor. 
Last week, we wept for Major Brent Taylor and his young family. This week, the tragedy of his death is projected upon the hundreds of thousands who, like him, gave their lives, their families, and their future for the country they loved. God bless them one and all. 
Serving Utah for 42 years, and a good man, this is well deserved. Congratulations to my friend, Senator Hatch. 
I want to thank Jeff Sessions for his service to our country as Attorney General. Under Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, it is imperative that the important work of the Justice Department continues, and that the Mueller investigation proceeds to its conclusion unimpeded. 
This campaign has been quite the ride. Thank you, Utah. 
Humbled by the support and trust of Utahns. I endeavor to represent you with dignity, integrity, and in a manner that will make you proud. 
Heartbroken with the tragic news of Major Brent Taylor‚Äôs death by gunfire in Afghanistan; a father of 7 small children, a city mayor, and a proud member of the Army National Guard. Another unmeasurable price is paid for freedom. 
Dan Jones was a political institution in Utah. For years his good work kept our political system on a straight and honest path. He will be missed, but his influence and impact will be felt by our state for years to come. 
On a rant... 
America is indebted as a democratic nation to the free press for truths it has uncovered, for truth it has disseminated, and for falsehoods it has repudiated. Read more at: 
.@pdoocy caught up with @MittRomney as the former presidential candidate went door-to-door to campaign for fellow Republicans @foxnewsnight 
Congrats to the fantastic Red Sox. We witnessed Saturday‚Äôs come-from-behind win in Dodger stadium with our grandkids. Last night, we celebrated game 5 in front of the TV. What a series! You made Red Sox nation proud. 
We are all children of the same God, each precious in His eyes. I mourn today for my Jewish brothers and sisters in Pittsburgh, subject to such hateful, bigoted violence. 
What a waste of our best meat! Elections have consequences - get out and vote! cc: @jdawgsutah 
Disgusting, vile threats and actions against fellow Americans and our institutions are sadly unsurprising: hate acts follow hate speech. It is past time for us to turn down and tune out the rabid rhetoric. 
Honored by the opportunity to cast my vote. Thankful for those who sacrificed to make it possible. Remember to mail in your ballot by Nov. 5th or vote in person on Nov. 6th. 
America can't excuse minimize the brutal gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident columnist. Our country is defined by human values, by principle above convenience, by commitment to morality. We must subject the perpetrators of this outrage to withering sanction. 
Balancing the federal budget takes more than rhetoric. If we are serious about balance, we have to look realistically at where the money is spent. Read more at: 
I hope and expect that Judge Kavanaugh's excellent record on the second highest court in the land will be matched by his work on the highest court in the land. 
I support the decision to re-open the FBI background investigation into the allegations made by Dr. Ford. It is my earnest hope that this will help inform the Senate and ensure the integrity of the Supreme Court. 
I concur with the statement from @LindseyGrahamSC 
Impressed by the efforts of our local firefighters and first responders fighting to keep communities affected by the Pole Creek and Bald Mountain fires safe. My heart goes out to those whose homes and safety are threatened. #PoleCreekFire 
Eagles Landing in Birdseye this morning. Grateful to Governor Romney for taking time to join me and understand the need for more resources and better decisions. #PoleCreekFire 
Honoring the selfless heroes and innocent victims whose lives were tragically and senselessly taken on this day so many years ago. #NeverForget 
The interest paid last year by American taxpayers on our $21 trillion debt was nearly $300 billion. With a booming economy, we should be shrinking the deficit, not growing it. 
When asked: ‚ÄúWhat is the best way to honor your husband‚Äôs legacy?‚Äù I say - Serve a cause greater than yourself, join me in the arena to fight for what is right. Share your inspiration for being #InTheArena ? 
Celebrating Labor Day at Golden Onion Days with my friends in Payson. 
Heavy hearts with the loss of a great friend. 
In a sea of politicians blown about by polls and passions, John McCain is as immovable as an anchor held fast by rock. He is a hero. He is a friend. 
No man this century better exemplifies honor, patriotism, service, sacrifice, and country first than Senator John McCain. His heroism inspires, his life shapes our character. I am blessed and humbled by our friendship. 
The events of the last 24 hours confirm that conduct by highly-placed individuals was both dishonorable and illegal. Also confirmed is my faith in our justice system and my conviction that we are a nation committed to the rule of law. 
The tragedy of wildfire strikes close to home today. My heart goes out to this fallen hero and his family. 
The equality of the intrinsic worth of every person is a truth fundamental to our national founding and moral order. Here are my thoughts on the one-year anniversary of Charlottesville: 
Drought and record temperatures mean that for Utah and other western states, devastating wildfires are increasingly the rule, not the exception. It is time to completely rethink and restructure our wildfire strategy. Here are my thoughts: 
Wishing all Utahns a safe and happy Pioneer Day. Grateful for my pioneer ancestors and their legacy of faith, hard work, and innovation. 
My statement on today's summit in Helsinki. 
Devastating: The impact of catastrophic wildfires continues for years after the fire is extinguished. Preventing such fires depends in large measure on better forest management. 
I can‚Äôt look! 
Esteemed by his colleagues, faithful to the Constitution, a record of thoughtful decisions, and already confirmed for the DC Circuit; Brett Kavanaugh has the right stuff. 
A weekend full of hiking and laughter to kick off our traditional grandkids trip. @ArchesNPS #DeadHorsePoint @TimpCaveNPS 
My thoughts on the trade war. 
Thinking of those impacted by the devastating fire in Duchesne and Wasatch counties. Praying for the success of those bravely fighting to prevent further damage. 
What makes our country exceptional is our people and our passion for freedom. How grateful we are to the Founders, to fighting men and women around the world, and to all who have sacrificed so that we may enjoy the liberties we have today. 
Thank you for your gracious support, Rep. Mike Kennedy, and your offer to counsel on Health policy. You show that we Republicans know how to battle in primaries and then how to come together in the general. 
Here‚Äôs where I stand on the Trump Agenda; I appreciate the argument made by those who believe we should stay silent, but I cannot subscribe to it. 
With Krauthammer now absent, the nation is bereft a full measure of character and integrity. Ann and I mourn the loss of this giant of truth. 
I agree that we need a more compassionate answer. 
.@AnnRomney and I exercised our right to vote by mailing in our ballots. Utahns, remember to vote by mail before June 25th or in person on June 26th. 
Charles‚Äô greatness derives not only from his brilliant mind, blinding insights, and searing commentary; it is that these are matched with goodness, moral grounding, and unspoiled character. Ann and I are heartsick with his news. 
LIVE: @MittRomney to keynote #UtahInnovationSummit followed by award ceremony including lifetime achievement award for LDS Church President @NelsonRussellM | #utpol #utahtech 
It took some cajoling, but I got a famous Utahn to star in my commercial. 
Congratulations @DougWrightShow on 40 years at @kslnewsradio and a well-deserved retirement. Our conversations over the years have been insightful and enjoyable. Thank you for being a voice of respect and civility for Utah. 
"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." (John 15:13) Today, we salute those who loved so greatly and promise to revere them always.

HAPPENING FRIDAY: A conversation with Mitt Ann about how principled leadership has guided them through challenging times #TeamMITT #utpol RSVP: 
Prayers for the First Lady and for Harry Reid. Hoping for healing and recovery for both. 
Robert Jeffress says ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt be saved by being a Jew,‚Äú and ‚ÄúMormonism is a heresy from the pit of hell.‚Äù He‚Äôs said the same about Islam. Such a religious bigot should not be giving the prayer that opens the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. 
Ann and I reflect daily on the lessons our mothers, Lois and Lenore, taught us about life, faith, and family. Today, we honor their memory and celebrate the many mothers in our lives. 
John McCain makes America great. Father, grandfather, Navy pilot, POW hero bound by honor, an incomparable and irrepressible statesman. Those who mock such greatness only humiliate themselves and their silent accomplices. 
My statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal. 
MUST LISTEN: @MittRomney's first interview on Saturday's convention results and his plan for the US Senate GOP Primary in Utah. #utpol @DougWrightShow 
Thank you to all the delegates who hung in there with us all day at the Convention. I appreciate the support I received and look forward to the primary election. 
Barbara raised a family of service character, stood by her beloved husband in the best worst of times, and spoke her convictions with courage passion. The great First Lady of our times. Ann and I will profoundly miss her friendship, her compassion, the twinkle of her eye. 
Celebrating Ann's birthday at home with some of our favorite "neighbors". Happy birthday, sweetie! 
Barbara, thank you for your faith and family. Thank you for your conviction, character and fortitude. Thank you for your charm, warmth and friendship. Thank you for the love you shared with us. Our prayers are with you, Ann and Mitt 
Love of country compelled Paul Ryan to accept the Speakership, a role he alone could fill at a critical time. He unified the House, passed scores of bills, and led with integrity, honor and dignity. The country will miss Speaker Ryan. 
Tonight at 5p @AnnRomney I will be at @Hale_Theater in Sandy. Hope you can join us! #TeamMITT 
He is risen! He is risen! Tell it out with joyful voice. He has burst his three days‚Äô prison; Let the whole wide earth rejoice. Death is conquered; man is free. Christ has won the victory. - Cecil Frances Alexander 
49 years today with the love of my life. 
Incredible caucus night here in Holladay and across the state. Thank you to all who participated in their neighborhood caucuses this evening and congratulations to tonight's elected delegates. I will work to earn your support in the coming month. #TeamMITT 
I encourage all Utahns to attend and participate in tonight‚Äôs caucuses. Visit to find your location and join #TeamMITT.

Today, I visited the office of LG @SpencerJCox to officially file for the US Senate race. In the month since I announced my candidacy, I‚Äôve driven nearly 4,000 miles to meet with Utahns in 20 counties. Hope I‚Äôll get the chance to meet you soon and earn your vote. 
Billy Graham lifted eyes toward heaven and instilled heaven‚Äôs values in hearts. The world mourns this man of character, this man of God. 
Thank you Mr. President for the support. I hope that over the course of the campaign I also earn the support and endorsement of the people of Utah. 
Never too many cooks in the kitchen. 
Out knocking doors this morning I met Paul and Orva Johnson‚Äîwas thrilled to earn their support! 
Thanks Mayor Vanleeuwen for the warm welcome at Jeremiah‚Äôs Restaurant this morning! 
Wonderful meeting with @UVU students today. It‚Äôs great to see Utah's college students politically active! 
This morning I went to @GreenAcresDairy to see their operation and hear about the agricultural issues our hardworking farmers face. Thank you, West Weber! 
Join #TeamMITT. Check out to get involved and sign up for updates. 
I am running for United States Senate to serve the people of Utah and bring Utah's values to Washington. 
Out of respect for the victims and their families, I will not be making an announcement tomorrow about the Senate race. (2/2) 
As a father and grandfather, my heart aches for the victims of today‚Äôs tragic events. My prayers go out to all of the families and loved ones affected by this senseless act of violence. (1/2) 
I stand in admiration of our Olympians' determination, sportsmanship, and patriotism. May they compete at their best on the world stage, inspiring us one and all. Good luck, @TeamUSA. 
With Jon Huntsman‚Äôs passing, we lose a Lion of Utah. Ann and I will profoundly miss our good friend‚Äôs broad smile, his hearty handshake and his example of faith, honor, and integrity. See my full statement on Facebook: 
Looking forward to making an announcement on February 15th about the Utah Senate race. 
Over the years, I‚Äôve witnessed the courage of athletes in Olympic Games but I‚Äôve never seen greater Olympic courage than that shown by our women gymnasts in the courtroom in Lansing, Michigan. 
The poverty of an aspiring immigrant‚Äôs nation of origin is as irrelevant as their race. The sentiment attributed to POTUS is inconsistent w/ America‚Äôs history and antithetical to American values. May our memory of Dr. King buoy our hope for unity, greatness, ‚Äúcharity for all.‚Äù 
Thomas S. Monson walked where Jesus walked, lifting the downtrodden, comforting the wounded, healing the sick, brightening the lives of the lonely at heart. Read my full statement: 
I join the people of Utah in thanking my friend, Senator Orrin Hatch for his more than forty years of service to our great state and nation. Read my full statement: 
Profoundly moving to watch those seeking freedom in Iran. Patriots afar remind us of the patriots who won our own freedom and also those who preserve it. Heroes all. 
Merry Christmas from our family to you and your family. 
Putin today blames US politics for icy relations. Get real: It was Russia invading sovereign nations, propping up dictators, hacking elections, abusing human rights, and cheating at the Olympics. 
By sanctioning Russia, Olympic officials place honor and integrity above money and politics. Russia under Putin is shown, once again, to place winning above the rule of law, above honesty, and above the interests of its own athletes. 
Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity. 
A very big week for Utah‚Äôs own Senator @OrrinHatch with tax reform, Bears Ears reversion, and a presidential visit. 
If 1,000 share this donate at least $1, then we can give eyesight to THIS MANY PEOPLE! Donate at #GivingTuesday #givesight #cureblindness #givesight25 
On Thanksgiving, you can never have too many cooks in the kitchen! 
On this Veterans Day, let‚Äôs honor our servicemen and women and take a moment to reflect on the sacrifices they make to ensure our liberty. 
Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman. Her account is too serious to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside. 
Congratulations, Congressman-elect Curtis! 
Happy to vote by mail today for John Curtis for Congress. 
Praying for the people of Sutherland Springs, who today were met with tremendous evil in their most sacred space. 
Overwhelmed today with thought of the pain and heartache suffered by victims and families in New York. God bless these fellow Americans. 
Ran against him, sometimes disagree, but proud to be a friend of @SenJohnMcCain: hero, champion of character and last night, Lincolnesque. 
Uncontrolled fires, loss of lives property = failure of prime govt responsibility, underinvestment in helos, planes, personnel, systems. 
Ann and I pray for the dead and wounded in the Las Vegas massacre. Grateful for the heroes who risked their lives to help the innocent. 
Congratulations to Jon Huntsman Jr. on confirmation as Ambassador to Russia. His experience and clear-eyed resolve are badly needed. 
Just spoke w/ fmr Gov @luisfortuno51: ‚ÄúPR on brink of humanitarian disaster." USVI too. DC must put aside controversies, prioritize rescue. 
Patriot, Uniter, Leader, Hero. 
President Trump gave a strong and needed challenge to UN members to live up to its charter and to confront global challenges. 
Harvard's about-face deserves credit; not easy to admit being wrong. 
Well done, Mike. And abject shame on Harvard. 
Harvey's historic devastation has been met with historic Texas compassion and resolve. A true testament to American character. 
Having created a natl inflection point of consequence, POTUS must apologize repudiate the racists. Full statement: 
No, not the same. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes. 
Racial prejudice, then hate, then repugnant speech, then a repulsive rally, then murder; not supremacy, barbarism. 
.@SenJohnMcCain‚Äôs patriotism and courage are vital to the nation. With the fearful news tonight, Ann and I pray for his recovery. 
Spoke this morning with @SenJohnMcCain re: his health, tax reform, Syria. A true "Timex hero‚Äù: He takes a licking and keeps on ticking. 
Celebrating independent speech, worship, and association; independence from autocracy; these defining rights and more won at great cost. 
This week, our granddaughter returned from her mission in France. So glad to have her home so proud of her work over the past 18 months. 
Congrats to @karenhandel on a big win in #ga6 tonight! We need more leaders like Karen in Washington.

Follow @E2Summit for official updates from #E2Summit17 in Park City. 
Affirmation of the #ParisAgreement is not only about the climate: It is also about America remaining the global leader. 
Our politics have become too base, too low, too vulgar, but Kathy Griffin's post descends into an even more repugnant vile territory. 
Today, we remember the fallen, who, as Pres Reagan noted, were all different "but they shared this in common: They loved America very much." 
#happymothersday to @AnnDRomney, who with 24 grandchildren, continues to be an example of strength and grace to a 2nd generation of Romneys.

Thought-provoking plan from highly respected conservatives to both strengthen the economy confront climate risks: 
Happy 105th birthday to my wonderful mother Roberta - we love you mom! 
An important and welcome choice: Judge Gorsuch will help restore much needed faithfulness to the Constitution. 
MLK inspired my mom: "We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline."

It was an honor to have been considered for Secretary of State of our great country. 
Honored today to help ordain my grandson Wyatt a deacon in my church. 
As a boy, John Glenn lifted my eyes to the heavens. Today, they welcome him back. 
Thank you, @NHJennifer for your steady hand guiding the NH GOP. Your leadership will be missed. 
No greater joy than making discoveries together with grandchildren. 
Thankful today for a full house and full heart. 
One of America's finest journalists gone far too soon. We will miss Gwen Ifill's brilliant voice and kind heart. 
Let us today honor the sacrifice and service of our heroic men and women in arms. #VeteransDay 
Best wishes also for the GOP victors in the House, Senate statehouses: may you govern with the high seriousness befitting our great nation 
Best wishes for our duly elected president: May his victory speech be his guide and preserving the Republic his aim. 
Great to spend some time in Arizona in support of my friend @SenJohnMcCain. We need his leadership in the US Senate. 
Gov. Romney: We need John McCain and the get-it-done-attitude #AZSen 
WATCH: @MittRomney 's speech at the @LegalReform #ILRSummit yesterday at the @USChamber: 
Be sure to head to the polls for GOP Senate, House and statehouses; they are essential to defend and advance constitutional conservatism. 
Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world. 
Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world. 
I shook the hand of a legend, a man whose life left the world larger and kinder. 
My good friend Ed Conard has a new book out today. Whether you agree with him or not, it‚Äôs a fascinating read. 
Fifteen years on, we remember the innocent who perished on 9/11, and salute the brave who have served in defense of our nation since. 
I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall. 
May we stop seeing people as black, white, brown or wearing blue see them instead as husbands, wives, sons, daughters children of God. 
Today, let‚Äôs pay tribute to the Founders who declared our independence and to the brave men and women who have fought to maintain it. 
I pray that the beacon that was Elie Wiesel will long guide us away from the shoals of hatred and racism. 
Bob Semonian, the very proper publisher of the Improper Bostonian, passed away today. We will miss our fine friend. 
Saving the Senate got a big boost with @marcorubio's decision today. Thank you, Marco for fighting on. 
As we mourn the victims of Islamic terror in Orlando, Ann I say a special prayer for the LGBT community that was the focus of this attack. 
Deeply saddened to learn of the horrific attack in Orlando. Our hearts go out to those who lost loved ones.

Mr. Trump, tear down that tax wall. 
God be with you, Bob, till we meet again at Jesus' feet.

God bless you for a full and rapid recovery. 
Happy birthday, @AnnDRomney, from me and from some of your favorite grandsons. 
With Barbara Anderson's passing, the Bay State has lost a tireless champion for tax fairness. 
Thankful this day and every day for Jesus Christ who conquered death and gave us the Way, the Truth and the Life. 
As a fmr missionary a father grandfather of missionaries, this is simultaneously heartbreaking heartwarming. 
President Obama's response is mind numbing. ISIS attacks are existential to every person who is killed! Stand with #Brussels. 
No, Not Trump, Not Ever 
This week, in the Utah nominating caucus, I will vote for Senator Ted Cruz. 
Trump has the best words. Take it from him. @AmFutureFund 
With the passing of Nancy Reagan, God and Ronnie have finally welcomed a choice soul home. 
If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement 
Full remarks from today's speech are up on @Medium 
ICYMI: Watch my speech on the state of the 2016 presidential race 
He's playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat. (2/2) 
Here's what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. (1/2) 
...endurance high purpose into the will to defeat the enemies of freedom. Our anger was transformed into energy directed for good. (2/2) 
I understand the anger Americans feel today. In the past, our presidents channeled that anger, and forged it into resolve, into... (1/2) 
A person so untrustworthy and dishonest as Hillary Clinton must not become president. But a Trump nomination enables her victory. 
She compromised our nat'l secrets, dissembled 2 families of the slain jettisoned her most profound beliefs 2 gain presidential power (2/2) 
On Hillary Clinton's watch at the State Department, America's interests were diminished in every corner of the world. (1/2) 
Trump relishes any poll that reflects what he thinks of himself. But polls are also saying that he will lose to Hillary Clinton 
All of them bear the responsibility of being an example for our children and grandchildren. (3/3) 
@MittRomney The president and yes the nominees of the country's great parties help define America to billions of people. (2/3) 
The president of the United States has long been the leader of the free world. (1/3) 
Trump says he admires Vladimir Putin, while he has called George W. Bush a liar. That is a twisted example of evil trumping good. 
Of remaining candidates the only serious policy proposals 2 deal w broad range of nat'l challenges we confront come from Cruz,Rubio Kasich 
But if we make the right choices, America's future will be even better than our past and better than our present. 
the growing assertiveness of China and the nuclear tests of North Korea confirm that we live in troubled and dangerous times. (2/2) 
At home, poverty persists and wages are stagnant. The horrific massacres of Paris and San Bernardino, the aggressions of Putin... (1/2) 
Watch my speech on the state of the 2016 presidential race LIVE on Facebook at 11:30 AM, ET 
Another #bombshell? Trump should authorize the @nytimes to release the transcript of his ed board interview. #WhatIsHeHiding 
A disqualifying disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK. His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America. 
@realDonaldTrump Facts are stubborn. I released my back taxes on 1/24/12. No excuse for hiding your back taxes. 
.@realDonaldTrump got it wrong: I released back taxes in Jan '12, early in primary process--just like he should do. 
.@realDonaldTrump taxes for last 4+ years are still being audited. There are more #bombshells or he would release them. 
No legit reason @realDonaldTrump can't release returns while being audited, but if scared, release earlier returns no longer under audit. 
Methinks the Donald doth protest too much. Show voters your back taxes, @realDonaldTrump. #WhatIsHeHiding 
Watch the full @MittRomney interview with Neil today on 'Your World': 
The case for waiting for the next president to name the next SCOTUS nominee was well expressed by Joe Biden. 
.@JebBush followed his family's pattern of putting country above himself. I am proud to call him a friend. 
New president should nominate new SCOTUS justice. Dems may complain, but they should talk to @chuckschumer. 
Courage and unwavering determination have defined the @CarlyFiorina campaign. Thank you for standing up and standing tall. 
Thank you @ChrisChristie for pushing the race towards real and honest solutions. Your candor and integrity on the trail will be missed. 
Hey @ABC: put @CarlyFiorina on the debate stage! She got more Iowa votes than John and Chris. Don't exclude only woman. 
RELEASE: My remarks from last night: ‚ÄúHappy birthday to you; happy birthday to you; happy birthday @SpeakerRyan‚Ä¶" 
4 years ago today, I released my taxes; became issue. 2016 candidates should release taxes before first contests. 
.@nikkihaley criticized the anger, not the policy. It was courage you can count on.

St. Patrick‚Äôs Day is one of my favorite times of the year, providing millions around the world a chance to gather with friends and family to celebrate the Irish's many cultural contributions and reflect on our shared heritage. Slainte! 
To be clear, GOP wins elections when they‚Äôre about ideas not when they‚Äôre personality contests like Dems media want. We‚Äôre clearly better off because of @RealDonaldTrump. His record of accomplishment is why he‚Äôll win re-election especially when compared to Dems‚Äô leftward lurch. 
Today, we bid farewell to @JohnDingell, a patriot who embodied ‚Äòservice before self.‚Äô Every member of the Congress should try to emulate the vim and vigor that John brought to the House daily. John‚Äôs impact was profound and he will be missed by many. 
On tomorrow night‚Äôs episode of #FindingYourRoots, we share stories about the ancestors of @TulsiGabbard, @SpeakerRyan and @MarcoRubio that illuminate the melting pot that defines America. Watch at 8/7c only on @PBS! 
Congressman Walter Jones was a true gentleman, a man of deep faith, and a man of principle, who selflessly served the people of North Carolina‚Äôs 3rd District. I was proud to work with him in the House of Representatives and my heart goes out to his wife and family. 
So, so proud of my father-in-law, Dan Little, who is the oldest person (76!) to ever complete the World Marathon Challenge. 7 marathons in 7 days on 7 continents. 
NEW oped by @bpmehlman The state of our union is better than you think -- here's why 
Robert Doar is an excellent choice to succeed the great Arthur Brooks @AEI. Robert is a smart, serious conservative dedicated to opportunity and upward mobility for all Americans, and I know he‚Äôll do great work leading this important institution. 
To all of our men and women around the world this holiday season, especially those of you from the great state of Wisconsin, I know it is said many times many ways: thank you for your service. 
There are many people around this place that I will miss, and no one deserves more respect for their service and their courage than the U.S. Capitol Police. What an honor to walk the same halls. 
Proud to sign Criminal Justice Reform legislation and send it the president to become law. Redemption is at the heart of the American Idea. These reforms will make our communities safer create a smoother path for the incarcerated to successfully reenter contribute to society. 
The House is indebted to Secretary Mattis for his service. With our country‚Äôs defense in his hands, we have become a safer America at home, and a more commanding force abroad. His patriotism and grit are matched only by his humility and graciousness. 
The House just passed criminal justice reform. This is something I have believed in for a long time. There is no reason a person who wants to redeem themselves, work hard, and contribute to their community should be deprived of that opportunity. 
Tune in live soon for @HouseGOP leadership‚Äôs final press conference of the 115th Congress: 
In this 21st-century digital age, it‚Äôs imperative we provide @DHSgov the resources it needs to streamline the process of identifying terror threats. @HurdOnTheHill‚Äôs Data Framework Act was signed by @POTUS and is now law of the land. 
Here‚Äôs to the people. Here‚Äôs to the People‚Äôs House. Here‚Äôs to possibilities. Thank you for everything. God bless America. 
Three years ago, we began a great journey to set our nation on a better path. Now, my season of service is coming to a close. Tune in live soon for my Farewell Address as Speaker of the House: 
@senatemajldr Thank you, Mitch. It‚Äôs been an honor to work with you to make America more prosperous and free. 
Criminal justice reform is about giving more Americans a chance at redemption. The House looks forward to sending it to the president to become law. 
.@RosLehtinen has been a tireless advocate for the people of Nicaragua. Pleased to see her legislation putting pressure the Nicaraguan government to hold free, fair, and transparent elections head to the @WhiteHouse. 
As a kid from Janesville, Wisconsin, I never thought I'd work on Capitol Hill, let alone be a member of Congress. I feel very blessed to have had these opportunities to make a real, positive difference in the lives of so many Americans. 
Once in a generation, you can convince politicians that the need for reform outweighs the needs of the special interests. That‚Äôs exactly what happened when we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one year ago this week. 
Becoming Speaker was bittersweet because I was leaving the job I always wanted: being in charge of tax policy as chairman of @WaysAndMeansGOP. So as Speaker, I did everything I could to pave the way for real, comprehensive tax reform. 
There is no way that that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would be the law of the land if we had just started last year. It took years of work in the @WaysandMeansGOP committee, and that‚Äôs the reason we were able to hit the landing in 2017. 
It was 2007. House Republicans had just lost the majority, and I was sitting in a deer hunting tree stand one Saturday morning. That‚Äôs when I decided to go big and put together a completely comprehensive plan to update the nation‚Äôs entitlement system and reform the tax code. 
Twenty years before it became law, tax reform was just an idea. This is how it all began. 
From the first day I came to Congress, I‚Äôve been fighting for comprehensive tax reform to keep America competitive. It‚Äôs a cause that has been decades in the making. 
Historic tax reform would not have been possible without @RepDianeBlack‚Äôs leadership as chair of @HouseBudgetGOP. It was an honor to accept her portrait into the House collection. 
Today, the House unanimously passed landmark legislation that improves accountability and transparency while addressing allegations of sexual harassment in Congress, and protects victims. 
Congratulations to my good friend @cathymcmorris for sending her 7th bill this Congress off to the White House to become law. She is a tireless advocate for ensuring every person has an opportunity for a better life, especially children and Americans with disabilities. 
At a time when America‚Äôs farmers and ranchers face steep challenges, this #FarmBill delivers certainty, expands access to broadband, better manages our forests, and makes important progress toward alleviating poverty. I look forward to sending this to the president‚Äôs desk. 
Reforming our criminal justice system is about redemption‚Äîgiving many Americans another chance to achieve a more fulfilling future. The House has already demonstrated our commitment to making substantive reforms and we welcome the Senate‚Äôs consideration of the FIRST STEP Act. 
This #FarmBill: ‚úÖDelivers certainty for our farmers ‚úÖStrengthens work requirements ‚úÖBoosts work supports ‚úÖGuards communities against wildfire risks 
The House and Senate have reached an agreement on the #FarmBill. Live soon, @HouseGOP leaders will discuss how this bill delivers the certainty and support our famers need. Tune in: 
This is a good day for farmers and families. The #FarmBill strengthens work requirements for our federal nutrition benefit programs, and uses savings to better train and equip our workforce‚Äîreforms we have long sought to help more Americans move from welfare to work. 
John Kelly is a patriot. Service to America is part of his DNA, and our country is better for his duty at the @WhiteHouse. He has my eternal gratitude. 
Today we remember the American lives lost and those injured in the attack on Pearl Harbor 77 years ago. We are ever grateful for the men and women in uniform who bravely serve on our behalf. 
President Trump has made an excellent selection by nominating @HeatherNauert to be @UN ambassador. We look forward to all that she will accomplish at the United Nations as an advocate for freedom, liberty, and human rights. 
The People‚Äôs Tree is lit! Merry Christmas! 
We‚Äôre lighting the Capitol Christmas Tree, which came all the way from Oregon this year. Watch now:

As Chairman, @LamarSmithTX21 enacted a record number of bills from the @HouseScience Committee‚Äîthe overwhelming majority of which were built with bipartisan consensus. It is an honor to accept a portrait of such an effective chairman into the House collection. 
Farewell, 41. 
At 94 years of age, President George H.W. Bush lived a full life of service‚Äîto others and to his country. America will forever be grateful for his leadership. 
Photos from yesterday‚Äôs Capitol ceremony honoring the life and service of our 41st president, George Herbert Walker Bush: 
As Americans, we have no more solemn duty than laying a great patriot to rest. In President George H.W. Bush, here lies such a man. 
George Herbert Walker Bush was a great leader and a good man. His memory will belong to glory. God bless the 41st president of the United States. 
To the Bush family: On behalf of the whole House‚ÄîRepublicans and Democrats‚Äîwe are profoundly sorry for your loss. And we are honored to celebrate this wonderful life with you.

When I was chair of @HouseBudgetGOP, we began to change the debate with the Roadmap for America‚Äôs Future. Now, all these years later, those early ideas of tax reform have become law and hundreds of millions of Americans are better for it. 
The United States stands with Israel now, tomorrow, and always. Thank you @AmbDermer for always working with us here in Congress to ensure a strong alliance between our two nations.

During his historic tenure as Librarian of Congress, Jim Billington led a great expansion of our most preeminent cultural institution. He was a great thinker, with a profound commitment to public service. A national treasure. I deeply admired him. The House mourns his passing. 
I have a long list of things to be thankful for this year, including the fact that deer hunting season has started in Wisconsin. 
So wonderful to see @senorrinhatch presented with the Medal of Freedom in recognition of his many years of diligent service to the people of Utah and Americans everywhere.

Great meeting with the new House Republican leadership team this morning. Glad to welcome @RepLizCheney as Chair of the @HouseGOP conference. 
Signed and sent off to the White House to become law ‚Üí Legislation to strengthen America‚Äôs cybersecurity with a dedicated agency under @DHSgov. This bipartisan bill is a vital piece of our national security. 
Redemption is at the heart of the American Idea, and that‚Äôs what this is about. The president‚Äôs announcement is an encouraging sign that we can achieve substantive reforms to our criminal justice system in this Congress. 
The GOP leadership team for the 116th Congress: ‚Ä¢ @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy ‚Ä¢ Whip @SteveScalise ‚Ä¢ @HouseGOP Chair @RepLizCheney ‚Ä¢ NRCC Chair @RepTomEmmer ‚Ä¢ Policy Cmte Chair @USRepGaryPalmer ‚Ä¢ Conference Vice Chair @RepMarkWalker ‚Ä¢ Conference Secretary @RepJasonSmith

To the three newly sworn-in Members from Rochester, NY; Tulsa, OK; and Delaware County, PA, welcome to Congress! 
I am shaken by the sudden loss of Damon Nelson, staff director of the House Intelligence Committee. Damon was a dedicated public servant and a truly kind and genuine person. We are praying for his wife and family at this tragic time. 
Those who fought for freedom are never forgotten. To all our veterans and their families on this #VeteransDay, thank you for your service and sacrifice. 
Whenever our nation needs you, you are there‚Äîfirst, last, and always. To all Marines and to your families: thank you! #MarineCorpsBirthday 
Happy 243rd birthday @USMC! Thank you to all Marines who have served our country. #SemperFi 
2 years ago, Republicans presented a #BetterWay to get the country back on track. It's working: ‚úî Wages are rising at their fastest rate in 9 years. ‚úî The economy is on track to grow at its fastest rate in 13 years. ‚úî Unemployment is the lowest it‚Äôs been in 48 years. 
7 million. That‚Äôs how many job openings there are across the country‚Äîmore jobs than people seeking them. That forces companies to pay higher wages and benefits to attract workers. 
RT if you agree ‚Üí single-payer, government-run health care would be a disaster. We need to save the current Medicare program for those in or near retirement, not raid it for a new entitlement. 
Yesterday‚Äôs jobs report was unquestionably positive: Wages rising, more Americans joining the labor force, and new jobs being created. These great numbers matter‚Äîthey‚Äôre making a real difference in the daily lives of Americans working to get ahead: 
The unemployment rate for Americans of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity fell to 4.4 percent in October, the lowest recorded level for this group since 1973. Here are some other changes to U.S. employment: 
Businesses hired 250,000 workers in October as wages rose most in 9 years 
Breaking: Economy added 250,000 jobs in October, up from 118,000 in September 
Wages are finally ticking up. Here‚Äôs why (via @gretchenfrazee) 
NEW: U.S. employers added 250,000 jobs last month and raised average pay by the most in nearly a decade. 
Wages increased last month and advanced 3.1% from a year earlier, the best year-over-year gain for average hourly earnings since 2009 
Americans are #BetterOffNow, but don‚Äôt just take our word for it. See what others are saying about the October jobs report. 
All this economic progress is a testament to what Americans‚Äîfamilies, workers, and business owners alike‚Äîcan achieve when government empowers them to succeed rather than getting in the way. 
Tremendous job gains, increase in labor force participation, and wages growing at 3.1 percent. Real improvements all around. Check out our updated @AEI infographic: 
#JobsReport: U.S. employers added a better-than-expected 250,000 jobs in October. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7 percent, the lowest rate in nearly 50 years, while the labor force participation rate increased to 62.9 percent. 
Man, this is a really great jobs report. The job market is firing on all cylinders: Strong job growth (esp for this stage of expansion), wages rising faster, more people in labor force. 
Breaking News: The U.S. economy added 250,000 jobs in October, as the last employment data before voting next week showed a record run of hiring rolling on. 
Blowout jobs growth of 250,000 bolsters Trump, GOP before elections 
U.S. employers added 250,000 jobs in October amid the best pay raises in nearly a decade. The jobless rate held at 3.7%. 
I‚Äôm not seeing anything bad in this jobs report. Strong hourly wage growth, even stronger weekly wage growth, higher labor force participation, lower broader underemployment, while job growth bounced back from last month and the unemployment rate remained low. 
@AP U.S. employers added a stellar 250,000 jobs last month and boosted average pay by the most in nearly a decade in an effort to attract and keep workers. 
In last employment report before election, U.S. economy shows strong recovery after hurricanes, adding 250,000 jobs in October 
BREAKING: US employers added a robust 250,000 jobs in October, lifting wages at fastest pace since 2009 in last snapshot of the US economy before next week's midterm elections. 
The jobs market remains hot, and wages are climbing at their fastest pace in more than nine years 
JUST IN: U.S. adds 250,000, jobless rate holds at 3.7% 
BREAKING: US economy added 250K jobs in October vs +190K expected; unemployment rate at 3.7% 
From an historic overhaul of our outdated tax code to massive improvements for our military, this Congress has accomplished some of the most useful conservative reforms in decades. The state of our Union is #BetterOffNow. 
While even one homeless veteran is too many, this is encouraging news. We remain committed to those who have served as they transition into civilian life. 
You don't want to miss this ‚û°Ô∏è "Wages and salaries jump by 3.1%, highest level in a decade," @CNBC. #BetterOffNow 
Good news‚Üí Wages and salaries have increased by 3.1%‚Äîthe highest level in a decade. 
Our hearts are with the Jewish community during this heavy time. Grateful to @POTUS for traveling to Pittsburgh today. Anti-Semitism has no home here, and we stand together against this hate. 
U.S. consumer confidence rose to an 18-year high this month 
As we face 21st-century challenges, robust cybersecurity is vital to our national security. Pleased to nominate @RepGallagher, Dr. Ravich, and Mr. Cilluffo to the Cyberspace Solarium Commission to develop a clear path forward for U.S. cybersecurity policy. 
Month by month, we‚Äôve seen consumer confidence rise, the job market strengthen, and unemployment decline. These things add up. 
Today‚Äôs report shows American consumers are empowered to spend again. These results are no accident‚Äîthis is what happens when we pass policies to help American consumers, workers, and businesses to generate economic growth and opportunity. 
This Congress has been unwavering in its efforts to stem the tide of opioid addiction and abuse. Yesterday, a sweeping, comprehensive legislative package was signed into law that addresses the epidemic from all angles. Learn more: 
HR 6 has been signed into law 
With this legislation comes the idea that no matter how dark your struggle seems, there is help available to you. There‚Äôs more to be done, but this is an opportunity to continue talking about this cause, to keep supporting each other, and to restore hope one life at a time. 
It helps stem the flow of opioids into communities by encouraging non-opioid prescriptions and helping law enforcement crack down on synthetic drugs like fentanyl. 
The legislation signed by the president today gives community leaders‚Äîthe people doing this vital work day in and day out‚Äîmore resources to help people get clean and stay clean. 
Following years of work, landmark legislation to fight the opioid crisis from all sides is now law. This marks a moment of hope. 
BREAKING NEWS ‚Üí @POTUS has signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act into law. #opioidcrisis 
At the White House as @POTUS prepares to sign into law the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, my legislation to combat the #opioidcrisis in Oregon and across the country. 
I'm at the White House today as @POTUS signs my legislation to combat the opioid epidemic, the INFO Act, into law as part of H.R. 6. H.R. 6 is the most complete legislative effort ever undertaken to address a single drug crisis. Watch here: 
Those behind such reprehensible acts must be brought to justice. We cannot tolerate any attempt to terrorize public figures. I am grateful to the @SecretService, Capitol Police, and all law enforcement who guard against these threats. 
Americans are more confident, job openings are at an all-time high, and our economy is now the world‚Äôs most competitive. Don‚Äôt let the Democrats‚Äô rhetoric steer you wrong. #BetterOffNow 
A plenitude of jobs and a gradual rise in wages is drawing women back into the labor force 
JUST NOW ‚Üí Major water infrastructure legislation signed into law. By making critical upgrades to our ports and waterways, we improve the flow of goods and services that is so vital to commerce and manufacturing. 
Margaret Thatcher had it right about socialism: "Eventually, you run out of other people's money to spend." 
Great news‚Üí More women are entering the workforce because of higher wages and job creation. The U.S. economy and our workers are #BetterOffNow. 
Single-payer, government-run health care would essentially destroy and obliterate ‚Üí the private health insurance system, ‚Üí the employer-sponsored health insurance system, ‚Üí oh and by the way‚ÄîMedicare as we know it. 
Human trafficking exploits our country‚Äôs most vulnerable. Congress has fought hard to stop these horrific crimes from occurring in our country‚Äî60-80% of U.S. online sex advertising volume has disappeared since we passed legislation cracking down on bad-actor websites this spring. 
Human trafficking is the world‚Äôs fastest-growing crime. And in Wisconsin, it's happening in each of the state‚Äôs 72 counties. This spring, Congress passed bipartisan legislation cracking down on bad-actor websites that facilitate these horrific crimes. 
The difference between Republicans and Democrats on border security could not be starker: ‚Üí Republicans are funding the wall and are for securing the border. ‚Üí Democrats want to abolish @ICEgov.

Afghan special mission units have made significant progress in thwarting the threat of terrorism in their own country. Met with President @AshrafGhani and other senior officials to discuss the future of Afghanistan. 
Fighting terrorism in this region remains in our nation‚Äôs vital interest. Chairman Thornberry and I traveled to several locations in Afghanistan to assess the conflict and it‚Äôs clear our military campaign has laid the foundation for our diplomatic efforts. 
There‚Äôs no greater honor than visiting our troops‚Äîand that‚Äôs why I wanted to thank the brave men and women serving in Afghanistan for my last congressional delegation as Speaker of the House.

Obamacare meant fewer choices. ‚ÄúMedicare for All‚Äù means no choices‚Äîit's a full government takeover of healthcare. This means everyone‚Äîno matter how much you like your plan‚Äîwould have their plan taken away. 
For too long, violent criminals have been able to skirt the law due to the DNA backlog. The Justice Served Act gives state and local prosecutors the needed resources to bring justice to cold cases. Proud to see it become law. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone on the Gulf Coast as Hurricane Michael approaches. We will be monitoring the storm, and Congress will continue to make sure resources are available to help with the recovery.

Nikki Haley has been a clear, consistent, and powerful voice for America‚Äôs interests and democratic principles on the world stage. She challenged friend and foe to be better. I am saddened that she is leaving the administration, but so grateful for her service. Thank you, Nikki. 
Republicans have focused on policies that will improve people‚Äôs lives‚Äîbut it‚Äôs becoming evident Washington Democrats don‚Äôt see things this way. They‚Äôve called for: ‚ùå Raising taxes on hardworking Americans ‚ùå Abolishing @ICEgov ‚ùå A full government takeover of health care

Every community has been affected by the #OpioidEpidemic. Helping those suffering at the hands of addiction has been a priority of this Congress. This overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation will save lives and I‚Äôm proud it will soon become law.

Now more than ever, we rely on the internet to discover new artists and listen to our favorite hits, but the way songwriters get paid is still stuck in past. The #MusicModernizationAct changes that and will make sure they are paid fair market value when their songs are played. 
This is big for songwriters. The #MusicModernizationAct ‚Ä¶ Passed in the Senate Passed in the House Headed to the White House to become law

Good news‚Üí America‚Äôs aviation system is headed for an upgrade. Today, the House will vote on bipartisan legislation to improve air travel for Americans, modernize airports, and upgrade aviation system technology.

Breaking ‚Üí The House just voted overwhelmingly to upgrade America's water infrastructure. This important action will improve ports, dams, and waterways to facilitate commerce within our borders and connect U.S. producers and consumers with the international marketplace. 
President Reagan charted the right course‚Äîit‚Äôs peace through strength, pro-growth economy, clear moral leadership. It is not a new formula. What we need is a new willingness to think big and go bold. 
For the first time since President Reagan in 1986, we came together to overhaul our tax code. We went from having one of the worst tax codes in the industrialized world to one that can compete with anyone. 
Free trade must always be an active instrument of American leadership. 
Too often, we think about peace through strength only in terms of military might. This discounts the value of our economic partnerships with allies. Tearing down trade barriers produces economic benefit to both us and our trading partners. 
For most of this decade, our military was forced to operate under a budget that hollowed out our forces. Aging equipment and maintenance lapses cost us lives. We put a stop to it. We are now fully funding our national defense and rebuilding our military. 
China has a communist system based on centralized power, despite the veneer of 21st-century capitalism. We must be clear: the China model poses a direct challenge to democratic capitalism as we know it. 
One of my first political memories is from a night in February of 1981. I remember watching President Reagan on TV in his first address to Congress, where he told the country: ‚ÄúThere is nothing wrong with America that together we can‚Äôt fix.‚Äù

Our thoughts and prayers are with the people in the Carolinas as Hurricane Florence approaches. We‚Äôre going to keep monitoring this storm, and Congress stands ready to assist in any way we can.

It‚Äôs difficult for American manufacturers to compete with foreign competitors when they face costly, needless taxes. Legislation providing tax relief to hardworking American manufacturers is now headed to the president‚Äôs desk. This is good news for workers and consumers. 
With record-low levels of unemployment, we still have millions of jobs unfilled. Manufacturing is booming and businesses are hiring and expanding. The time is now to help people move from welfare to work.

Following tax reform: ‚Üí@USDOL reports worker bonuses have hit a record high ‚ÜíProjected GDP has increased by $6.1 trillion over the next decade ‚Üí@CommerceGov reports wages salaries are growing almost 25% faster now than under the Obama administration

Signed, sealed, and soon to be delivered to the @WhiteHouse to become law‚Üí a complete overhaul of America‚Äôs career and technical education system, to better equip our workers with the skills they need to get ahead. 
One step closer to @POTUS‚Äô desk ‚Üí the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. We‚Äôre continuing to rebuild our military with the resources they need to keep us safe and free. 
This career and technical education bill is something we‚Äôve been working on for years, especially @CongressmanGT, @virginiafoxx, and @EdWorkforce. It's their commitment to America‚Äôs workers that made this happen. 
Breaking News‚Üí The House just overwhelmingly voted to give our troops their largest pay raise in nearly a decade. This defense funding bill also provides our armed forces with the resources they need to face emerging challenges. We are one step closer toward a rebuilt military!

.@SpeakerRyan: "Two years ago, we House Republicans ran on a platform called A Better Way and then along with the newly elected @POTUS, guess what we did? We did what we said we were going to do." 
This is the comeback story that we said was possible in our Better Way agenda, and over the past two years, we have delivered for this country. As a result, Americans are #BetterOffNow. 
Two years ago, the House Republicans‚Äô agenda was around A Better Way. We spent time putting together that agenda ‚Äî A Better Way on our economy on our national security. Now, two years later, we‚Äôve kept our promises and today we see the results. 
.@SpeakerRyan: "We have 4% unemployment. More job openings than people looking for work in America today. Wages are up. The economy is soaring." 
Next stop for the bipartisan H.R.2353, Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act? The White House.

As citizens, we can all make a real difference. We can all do something to improve our civic life. Let us all aim to raise our gaze. We don‚Äôt have to be trapped by cynicism. 
Civility is a civic imperative‚Äîengaging in a healthy discourse in search for common ground. We should aim to accept good ideas, even if our side didn‚Äôt come up with them. That's one way we rediscover our common humanity. 
We cannot let our divisions overtake our basic respect for another. We can take the oxygen out of tribalism and identity politics by rediscovering our common humanity. 
More and more, our politics is enabling the worst in us. We‚Äôve become blind to other perspectives. We‚Äôre more connected then ever, but also more disconnected and alienated. That‚Äôs what concerns me most about our civic life. 
By rediscovering our common humanity, we can aim to restore civil discourse and strengthen civil society. I‚Äôll be discussing this topic live soon:

Not just Obama-era #WOTUS repeal! We reduced regulatory burden on farmers and ranchers, funded clean water and water infrastructure initiatives, AND bolstered funds to clean up more Superfund sites. 
In preparing Americans for jobs in our modern economy, we‚Äôve been stuck using 20th-century tools to address 21st-century problems. Today‚Äôs @WhiteHouse executive order will encourage public-private partnerships to better equip our workers with the skills they need to get ahead.

Germany is an important ally. With the threats we face around the globe, a strong and secure NATO is critical. An important part of that is adherence to the 2% GDP commitment on defense. Discussed this, and the strength of the U.S.-German relationship, with @GermanAmbUSA Haber.

The American people are #BetterOffNow because of our pro-growth policy agenda that has been tackling the biggest challenges everyday families are facing. 
Republicans are delivering on our #BetterWay agenda. As a result, America is stronger at home and abroad, with a booming economy, safer communities and a revived military. Visit to learn how we are #BetterOffNow.

There are more than 12 million able-bodied Americans who do NOT have small kids at home, are NOT in school, and are NOT working or looking for work. A mild work/school requirement of 20-hours/week to receive government assistance is as reasonable and common sense as it gets.

America has shown what we can achieve when we reapply our founding principles and renew our aspirational spirit. Let us continue with this work. Let us continue on the path of growth and opportunity. 
Just as our standing was threatened as countries around the world made their tax codes more competitive, we risk being left behind in global trade, as well, if we don‚Äôt lead. 
Through tax reform, all 50 states have now designated #OpportunityZones in their lowest-income census tracts. In these more than 8,000 zones, private investors are encouraged to bring economic development and long-term investment into these communities. 
In this economy, with all of the opportunities available, there could not be a better time to help more people move from welfare to work. 
RT to agree ‚Üí You shouldn‚Äôt have to pile up mountains of debt for college just to get the skills you need for a career. 
Right now, there are actually more job openings in America than there are job seekers. We need to close the skills gap. 
For America's workers, tax reform has been a real sea change. Now employers are having to actually compete for workers. More than 600,000 people came off the sidelines and joined the labor force last month, because they know they are #BetterOffNow. 
By just about any economic measure, the American people are #BetterOffNow. ‚úî 9 out 10 are keeping more of their paychecks ‚úî 5.5 million have already received bonuses, raises, and benefits ‚úî $300 billion was repatriated last quarter, the most on record 
In 2017, Republicans: ‚Üí began to lift the tangle of red tape that was suffocating #smallbiz. ‚Üí overhauled the tax code, with lower rates and a nearly doubled standard deduction. ‚Üí helped America leapfrog foreign competitors with a competitive corporate tax code. 
Not too long ago, America was on a very different and dangerous path. We were drifting toward a low-wage, low-growth future. Other countries took advantage of our outdated tax code, taking our jobs and our capital. That‚Äôs why in 2016, @HouseGOP offered a #BetterWay.

We have gone from a nation that asks ‚Äòwhere are the jobs?‚Äô to one that asks ‚Äòwhere are the workers?' Great news to see so many Americans rejoin the labor market.

"The unemployment rate inched up to 4%... But even that reflected a healthy economy: It rose because more than 600,000 Americans joined the work force. The job market is so good, many people who had previously given up looking are starting again."

The following members will lead negotiations for reforms to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. 
After years of being hollowed out, we are on the road to rebuilding our military. The 2018 #NDAA is about keeping the promises we‚Äôve made to our service members and their families. The following @HASCrepublicans members have been named to the House-Senate conference committee. 
In his decades of faithful service on the bench, Justice Kennedy has been a man of integrity and decency. He has earned the respect of the House and the American people. I look forward to @POTUS nominating a qualified successor who will be dedicated to upholding the Constitution. 
For years, our military has been hollowed out. This year‚Äôs defense bill is all about ensuring our Armed Forces can operate efficiently and effectively. We must make sure our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to fulfill their missions. 
My bill, the Small Business Investment Opportunity Act, has been signed into law! Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and ensuring they have adequate access to capital is key in ensuring their lasting success. Read more here: 
The SCOTUS ruling in Janus v. AFSCME is a win for individual freedom for public sector employees. Read Chairwoman @VirginiaFoxx and Subcommittee Chairman @RepWalberg statement on the ruling ‚§µ 
A generation of the people‚Äôs representatives have become accustomed to a failed budget process. This has to change, and soon. I urge the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform to reach a bipartisan consensus on solving our broken budget process. 
Biennial budgeting offers a path to rewriting this process‚Äîit brings renewed transparency accountability so we're better stewards of taxpayer dollars. Two years is about the timespan for congressional agreements on discretionary spending. Let‚Äôs make this our standard practice. 
Continuing resolution after continuing resolution, and all of these omnibuses, are not in the best interest of our country. What we need are bold reforms to the congressional appropriations process. 
I‚Äôve often lamented that the budget process was broken‚Äî"organized chaos‚Äù would be too generous a description. It is clearly time for a new approach to creating our country‚Äôs budgets. 
WATCH: The Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform hosts Members‚Äô Day, including testimony from @SpeakerRyan and other members of Congress. Tune in live now: 
Thank you @KingAbdullahII @QueenRania for meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Capitol today to discuss America's and Jordan‚Äôs shared interest of stability in the Middle East. 
Every day, firefighters put themselves in harm‚Äôs way. This bill allowing researchers to better understand the impacts of smoke inhalation on firefighters‚Äô health will lead to better treatment options for these first responders. Next stop‚Üí the @WhiteHouse. 
This year‚Äôs defense funding bill gives our service members their biggest pay raise in nine years. What our country‚Äôs troops do is nothing short of remarkable‚Äîthis raise is well-deserved. 
After tax reform, @HouseGOP‚Äôs top priority was to rebuild our military. I‚Äôll be speaking about the steps we‚Äôre taking to address our country‚Äôs readiness crisis soon: 
The deadly #opioidcrisis is ravaging communities across our nation. See what we are doing to stop it at 
The House passed over 70 bills that target specific weaknesses in the treatment and prevention of opioid addiction. Together we‚Äôre working to combat this horrible #OpioidEpidemic. 
Dr. Charles Krauthammer was a widely respected thinker and writer who used his immeasurable gifts to contribute to our civic discourse. If we can emulate his spirit and sense of wonder, we‚Äôll be wiser for it. My prayers are with his family, friends, and colleagues. 
Today, a #bipartisan group of 396 Representatives got together and voted for a ‚Äúmassive‚Äù package of bills to help in the fight against the #OpioidCrisis ‚Äì @NBCNews summed it up for you 
Over the last six months, I‚Äôve visited dozens of businesses across the country to hear directly from company leaders and employees about how #TaxReform has helped improve their lives. Here is a recap of my tour stops 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law six months ago today, but it was a moment that was decades in the making. 
NEW: House passes largest opioids legislative package in recent history, with provisions directing federal agencies to prioritize training, support recovery centers and conduct research on multiple fronts to help combat the growing epidemic. 
Something big indeed. America is back! Read my op-ed in the @WSJ ‚¨áÔ∏è 
These kinds of bipartisan moments don‚Äôt always make it into the top of your newsfeed, but this Congress‚ÄîRepublicans and Democrats‚Äîwon‚Äôt stop until we‚Äôve ended this opioid epidemic. 
Just in‚Üí House Republicans and Democrats came together pass the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act in order to combat the #OpioidCrisis. This is a big deal in the fight against the largest public health crisis in our country. 
Today‚Äôs SUPPORT bill fights the #OpioidCrisis by ‚úîAdvancing treatment and recovery programs ‚úîImproving prevention efforts ‚úîProviding resources to communities ‚úîFighting deadly drugs like fentanyl We won‚Äôt stop until we‚Äôve ended this epidemic. 
Speaker Ryan's Tribute to Charles Krauthammer 
Our nation is facing an #OpioidCrisis. Soon, I‚Äôll be speaking on the House Floor about how the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act will help our people and our communities. Tune in 
Charles Krauthammer was one of the great thinkers of our time. A giant in his intellect and his character. A good and gracious man. And a dear friend. This is such a loss. Our prayers are with his family, friends, and colleagues. 
Today‚Äôs House passage of the #2018FarmBill is a big deal. With our booming economy, there is no better time to close the skills gap, better equip our workforce, and encourage Americans to move from welfare to work. 
BREAKING: House advances the #2018FarmBill. H.R. 2 provides certainty to farmers and ranchers who have been struggling under the weight of a 5-year recession and provides work-capable #SNAP recipients with the hand up they need to find work to support their families. @ConawayTX11 
Another reason to celebrate the 6-month anniversary of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct? Utility bills are dropping for over 80 million Americans because of #TaxReform 
‚ÄúThis is the time to get people off the sidelines, out of poverty, into the workforce, into school, so that they can reach their version of the American Idea‚Äîtheir version of the American Dream.‚Äù -@SpeakerRyan #FarmBill2018 
.@SpeakerRyan: "There are more job openings in this country than there are people looking for work." 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre never going to be complacent. We‚Äôre going to continue to fight for American workers and American families to make sure that this is the best place on earth for that new job.‚Äù - Chairman @RepKevinBrady on 6-month anniversary of GOP #TaxCuts Law 
In just six months. #TaxReform has meant: ‚úÖ Economic resurgence ‚úÖ Higher pay for workers ‚úÖ More job openings ‚úÖ More #MadeInAmerica products 
We do not want children taken away from their parents. Yesterday‚Äôs action by @POTUS will ensure families can remain together while we enforce our immigration laws. In a few short hours, the House will take further action on legislation to address our broken immigration system. 
Soon, I‚Äôll be speaking about the situation at the border and the strength of the American economy at my weekly press conference. Tune in: 
The US is now in a pro-growth cycle where Americans are confident, they're risk-taking, they're hiring, and wages are going up. This economic optimism won't solve all of our problems, but it makes all of our problems easier to solve. 
Six months ago today, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the good economic news continues to roll in. 
The Capitol Hill community came together tonight at the @CWSoftballGame to raise awareness and money to #BeatCancer. Congrats to the press team on their victory. Members, you put up a valiant effort, but there‚Äôs always next year. 
Great piece from @SpeakerRyan highlighting all the reasons #taxreform is making American workers and businesses feel more confident in their futures. #TaxCutsandJobsAct 
.@SpeakerRyan on the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 6 months since it was passed: "More than 1 million jobs have been created in the last 6 months since tax reform. Unemployment is at its lowest level in half a century." 
Looking forward to tonight‚Äôs Congressional Women‚Äôs Softball Game against the DC press corps to benefit breast cancer patients. ‚öæ #BeatCancer #BeatThePress 
Today marks six months since Congress passed a historic reform of our country‚Äôs tax code. In this short amount of time, #TaxReform has proven to be the game-changer our economy and American workers needed. 
Thanks to the Republican-led tax law, America is experiencing a boom in US manufacturing. ‚öôÔ∏è 
.@SpeakerRyan: "In just 6 months, tax reform has already improved so many people's lives." 
.@SpeakerRyan is right: "Tax reform has improved American lives in just six months." Check out his @CNBC piece on #TaxReform here: 
Tax reform is working, not just for our economy, but for American workers, too.

Commentary: Paul Ryan: Tax reform has improved American lives in just six months 
Six months ago this week, historic #TaxReform was passed and signed into law. It has been a game-changer for the American economy, American job creators, and American families. 
.@SpeakerRyan: "We do not want children taken away from their parents. We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart. The administration says it wants Congress to act and we are. Tomorrow, the House will vote on legislation to keep families together." 
We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart. Tomorrow, the House will vote on legislation to keep families together. 
Tune in for this morning's news conference with @HouseGOP leadership, where we'll talk about the situation at the border and the strength of the American economy. 
It‚Äôs been 6 months since the House passed #TaxReform and since then: ‚úÖ 1 million jobs created ‚úÖ Unemployment dropped to 3.8% ‚úÖ 48 states are seeing lower utility rates ‚úÖ workers are seeing higher wages and bigger paychecks 
The United States and Spain have many shared priorities. I was delighted to meet with His Majesty King Felipe VI today to reaffirm our strong bilateral ties. 
This is the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history. Last week the House passed 38 #opioid bills focused on: ‚úì Treatment and recovery ‚úì Prevention ‚úì Protecting communities ‚úì Fighting fentanyl 
The #OpioidCrisis has impacted communities across the country. By the end of this week, the House will have considered more than 50 pieces of legislation to support prevention, aid recovery, and protect our communities. 
Who‚Äôs affected by opioids? The better question is: ‚ÄúWho hasn't been touched by the opioid crisis in America?‚Äù READ Chairman @RepKevinBrady‚Äôs op-ed in @theHill ‚¨áÔ∏è 
Opioid overdose is now the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50. The House will not relent in confronting the epidemic that is cutting short 115 lives each day. 
My life changed the day I became a father. Liza, Charlie, and Sam are my highest priority. Wishing all of the dads out there a happy early #FathersDay 
In honor of #FathersDay , @SpeakerRyan and I went head to head with some of our best #dadjokes. They weren't good... 
Bad Dad Jokes for Father‚Äôs Day: @SpeakerRyan and @PatrickMcHenry face off with lame puns

The House is hard at work passing legislation that will continue to strengthen our economy. These two bills helping our communities' #SmallBiz are off to become law. 
For the countless prayers and support on this journey ‚Äî thank you.

Happy birthday to President Trump! 
The American flag is the greatest symbol for democracy and freedom that the world has ever known. Happy #FlagDay! 
2.7 million people across the country are struggling with opioids. We‚Äôre losing 115 lives each day to the #OpioidCrisis. That‚Äôs why the House is acting on more than 50 initiatives to tackle this issue from all sides. 
The #OpioidCrisis is an epidemic in the truest sense of the word. I‚Äôll be speaking more about why this needs to be an all-hands-on-deck effort, live soon: 
Jobless claims just fell to a near 44-year low. 
When I announced my retirement from Congress, much of the media focused on what I was giving up. All I could think about was what I was gaining‚Äîand that is the chance to spend time with my kids. 
Around this time last year, I was in my office on the phone with @SteveScalise's wife. We didn‚Äôt yet know that Steve-o had such a long fight ahead of him. But one year later, we know our prayers were answered. 
This is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. So glad to be here speaking at the #NHPB18 this morning. 
It's more than a game. 
Rep. Sam Johnson is an absolute hero for his sacrifice as a POW and his continued service to America. It is a privilege to accept his portrait as the newest addition to the House‚Äôs Collection. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created 320 Opportunity Zones in Ohio. That‚Äôs 320 economically-distressed Ohio communities, many of which ‚Äì thanks to tax reform - are seeing the hope of new investment for the first time in years. #TaxReform 
Thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, there are now 252 ‚ÄúOpportunity Zones‚Äù throughout North Carolina. These ‚ÄúOpportunity Zones‚Äù use tax incentives to attract investment and create opportunity for economically distressed communities. 
The time is now ‚Üí We need to step up and fight the opioid epidemic from all sides. Kyle is proof that no matter how far we fall, all of us can pick ourselves up with a little help and a little hope. 
Bills passed in Washington alone will not stop this epidemic. We all have a role to play in supporting those affected, including putting an end to the stigma surrounding addiction. Addiction does not define a person, and there is no shame in wrestling with it or asking for help. 
This week, we are voting on the most significant congressional reforms against a single drug crisis in history. Bipartisan legislation to: ‚úî Establish more recovery centers ‚úî Change how pills are prescribed ‚úî Encourage non-opioid treatments and much, much more. 
For Kyle Pucek, an ankle injury at 23 turned into an addiction to heroin that nearly took his life. Kyle has been clean for more than 4 years now, and his story is inspiring Congress to take action. 
Thanks to #TaxReform, #SC has received 135 #OpportunityZones, which encourages long-term investments and boosts the economy in our communities! 
Michelle's story ‚Äì and the thousands like it across the country ‚Äì are the reason our members are working on legislation to combat the #OpioidCrisis. Including bills to educate patients providers, block opioids from international mail, and explore alternative methods of care. 
Take a moment today to read @SpeakerRyan's piece in @journalsentinel about "How Congress is stepping up to crack down on the opioid epidemic" 
The #OpioidCrisis touches all of our communities. Michelle is a mother of two from Southern Wisconsin. Both of her sons became addicted to prescription painkillers, and later, heroin. Hear more about her family‚Äôs story ‚û°Ô∏è 
115 lives are lost every day to the #OpioidCrisis. These statistics are harrowing. Learn more about how the House is continuing to take action to tackle this epidemic, live soon: 
Tomorrow. 
From cementing a conservative judiciary to helping guide historic tax reform into law, and always looking out for Kentucky, no one has been more steady and focused on results than @SenateMajLdr. Congrats, Mitch on becoming the longest-serving Republican leader in Senate history. 
As a part of @HouseGOP‚Äôs historic #TaxReform, Wisconsin has received 120 #OpportunityZones to help spur investment and economic growth in our communities! 
And unemployment is at a historically low 3.8%. #TaxReform works! 
A booming economy doesn‚Äôt just happen. It develops when sound, pro-growth policies are written and passed, policies that are focused on the priorities of everyday Americans across the country. That is what we have done and that is what we will continue to do. 
Dozens of bills aimed at combating the #OpioidCrisis will hit the House Floor today. Get the latest from @USATODAY on these efforts, which will help our friends, family, and neighbors &gt;&gt; 
‚úÖ Lowest unemployment rate in half a century ‚úÖ Highest optimism from #smallbiz in 30+ years ‚ùå Predictions of tax reform leading to ‚ÄúArmageddon‚Äù and ‚Äúthe end of the world‚Äù 
Awesome news. Can‚Äôt wait to see you out there, Steve-o! 
Only time will tell if North Korea is serious this time, and in the meantime, we must continue to apply maximum economic pressure. The road ahead is a long one, but today there is hope that @POTUS has put us on a path to lasting peace in the Korean peninsula. 
We must always be clear that we are dealing with a brutal regime with a long history of deceit. 
For decades, American policy toward North Korea has failed, and I commend @POTUS for not accepting the status quo. As negotiations now advance, there is only one acceptable final outcome: complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization. 
.@GeorgeHWBush is a national treasure. Retweet to join me in wishing him a happy 94th birthday! 
Glad that you are already feeling better, @larry_kudlow. Praying for a full and speedy recovery for my friend. 
Small business optimism just rose to its highest in more than 30 years. 
This week, we're taking action to combat the #OpioidCrisis, which is truly the #CrisisNextDoor. The House will consider a wide-ranging group of bills to empower our communities in this fight. Read more about these bills here &gt; 
@jamiedupree Glad to hear you'll be back on the airwaves soon! 
Some good news ---&gt; House set to vote on more than 20 bills to combat opioid addiction @CNNPolitics 
On the agenda next week to prevent, treat, and help people recover from addiction‚Üí House set to vote on more than 20 bills to combat the opioid crisis. 
Had the pleasure of meeting Kayla a few months back. She truly is an inspiration to all of us and a great advocate for individuals with Down syndrome. 
Over the next two weeks, the House will consider meaningful legislative solutions to combat the opioid epidemic. It's been a privilege to collaborate with victims, physicians, first responders fellow lawmakers to find ways to tackle this #CrisisNextDoor. 
As a proud #MiamiOH alum, I always enjoy it when fellow #RedHawks stop by the office. Had a great discussion about current events with these bright @MiamiUniversity students participating in the Inside Washington program this week. #LoveAndHonor 
Bonuses and bigger paychecks aren‚Äôt the only ways #TaxReform is helping American workers. @Boeing, @McDonalds, @Walmart, @Disney, and @Kroger are a few of the many companies that are using their tax savings to invest in their workers‚Äô education. 
The Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act gives state and local law enforcement agencies the resources they need to stop gang violence and curb the rise of MS-13. Critical for communities across #VA01! 
JUST NOW‚Üí House Republicans voted to cut $15 billion in wasteful government spending‚Äîthe largest rescission package in history. 
Joined @RepGoodlatte and @RobWittman as @SpeakerRyan enrolled my anti MS-13 gang bill today. This legislation will help give the necessary resources to gang task forces. #VA10 
1,000,000. That's how many new jobs have been created since #TaxReform took effect. It's been less than 6 months. 
The #OpioidEpidemic has brought harrowing losses to our communities and has cut short too many futures. With the @WhiteHouse‚Äôs new initiative to fight youth opioid abuse, and the measures the House continues to work on, we‚Äôre resolute in the fight against this scourge. 
Gangs like MS-13 prey on our country‚Äôs young people through chilling violence and recruitment tactics. It‚Äôs crucial local law enforcement has every resource at its disposal to stomp out these monstrous threats. This bill, authored by @RepComstock, is off to the @WhiteHouse. 
Great news ‚Üí The House just started debate on the largest rescission package in history. This budget-cutting tool will allow us to cut nearly $15 billion in unused and unnecessary government spending.

Good news across the board but especially for Americans who‚Äôve been out of work and those seeking to transition from part time to full time opportunities. 
To tackle the multi-generational poverty trap, we must change our approach to fighting poverty. Instead of measuring success by how many people are in government programs, we should measure success by how many people have been able to leave them.

My op-ed in today's @DCExaminer: How tax reform brings opportunity to poor neighborhoods 
Oregon: The state has designated 86 #OpportunityZones, with business owners becoming excited about the opportunity to create jobs in their communities. 
Iowa: Officials are seeing a ‚Äúwaiting list‚Äù of potential investors for the state‚Äôs 62 #OpportunityZones, springing optimism for the potential success of these communities. 
West Virginia: @WVGovernor says the state‚Äôs 55 #OpportunityZones continue "our movement forward and the hope for brighter days ahead.‚Äù 
Michigan: Kalamazoo County contains 5 of the state‚Äôs 288 #OpportunityZones. County leaders believe these zones will spur and create community investment in these distressed areas. 
Massachusetts: Gloucester community officials are hopeful that its designated #OpportunityZones will attract investors, boosting its economy. 
Illinois: 327 #OpportunityZones throughout 85 counties. @GovRauner‚Üí ‚ÄúThese zones include some of the most underserved areas of the state that have the greatest potential for improvement.‚Äù 
North Carolina: 252 of its lowest-income areas have been designated as #OpportunityZones. This is great news for the state‚Äôs rural communities. 
The American economy is in great shape. And thanks to #TaxReform, states and local communities will start to see the benefits of #OpportunityZones‚Äîpockets of the country targeted for economic revitalization. 
Some #FeelGoodFriday news to wake up to: US unemployment drops to 3.8%, matching its lowest point in half a century. The economy added 223,000 jobs in May.

Honored to host veterans and their families from Walter Reed at the Capitol for the annual #MemorialDay concert yesterday. One way to honor those who have given the ultimate sacrifice is to honor their comrades and our Gold Star families. 
The blessings of freedom come at a dear cost. On #MemorialDay, we honor the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice for the cause of freedom. We are forever indebted to their service and sacrifice. 
In our country, religious freedom is an unwavering right. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not the case around the world. Welcomed U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback to the office to hear about his work defending religious minorities abroad. 
Today, I joined the House signing of legislation which was also signed into law by the President. In it are bipartisan reforms that make it easier for small businesses to get a loan and remove unnecessary obstacles to home ownership, among other important provisions.

Terminally ill patients‚Äîand their families‚Äîdeserve the #RightToTry experimental treatments and therapies for the chance at a longer life. Could not be more proud to send this bill to @POTUS to become the law of the land. 
Today, we turned good ideas into real results to help improve people‚Äôs lives. Bills that provide terminally ill patients with the #RightToTry, unleash our economy, and take care of our #veterans are off to the @WhiteHouse to become the law of the land. 
Great news‚Üí This year‚Äôs National Defense Authorization Act just passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. We are keeping our promise we made to the men and women in uniform: We are rebuilding our military. 
North Korea has long given ample reason to question its commitment to stability. Congress has provided significant tools to hold North Korea accountable. The US must not relent in this maximum pressure campaign as we continue to work with our allies toward a peaceful resolution. 
We made a promise to the men and women of our Armed Forces to start rebuilding our military, to give them the resources they need, and to reassert the our country‚Äôs dominance in the world. This year‚Äôs #NDAA will be another promise kept. 
The House has been keeping its promises to unleash the economy, to take care of our #veterans, and to give terminally ill the #RightToTry. I‚Äôll be signing these three major pieces of legislation live soon: 
Let us recommit ourselves to living not just successful lives, but faithful lives. There are deeply pervasive cultural problems before us. Now is the time for Catholics to step up and help bring our country closer to its great moral potential. #CatholicPrayerBreakfast 
For generations, Catholics in this country have been healers of the walking wounded. We must insist public policy at every level permit Catholic institutions the freedom to help all who look to the Church for the help they need to live lives of purpose. #CatholicPrayerBreakfast 
I recently visited @CCFortWorth to witness their customized approach to case management. They empower clients not to settle, instilling in them a sense of self-worth. This is the heart of subsidiarity‚Äîthe institutions closest to us can do the most good. #CatholicPrayerBreakfast 
Catholic social doctrine provides us with a way to conduct our public discourse. Democracy requires a sense of civic friendship‚Äîeven when we disagree, our neighbors are our partners in this common enterprise. Every person has a role and a voice. #CatholicPrayerBreakfast 
We live in a world where moral relativism has become pervasive, laying the groundwork for identity politics tribalism. 21st century technology has only exacerbated this. It's important we take time to reconnect with our faith‚Äîwith our place in humanity. #CatholicPrayerBreakfast 
We live our lives at such a relentless pace. There‚Äôs rarely time to be still‚Äîto pray. I‚Äôll be addressing the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast soon about the need to reconnect with our faith. Watch: 
Our troops are our most valuable asset. They deserve to be equipped to with the resources they need to safely and efficiently serve our country. 
This year‚Äôs defense authorization bill: ‚úîGives our troops their biggest pay raise in 9 years ‚úîProvides training for all branches ‚úîUpdates military infrastructure ‚úîSupports the development of new technologies ‚úîEliminates bureaucratic red tape #NDAA 
After years of being hollowed out, Congress recently passed the largest increase in defense funding in 15 years. It‚Äôs imperative that we continue to strengthen our military to face the threats of the 21st-century. 
The U.S. Coast Guard plays a vital role in the security of our nation. Met with incoming @USCG Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz to welcome him to his post and discuss plans to increase readiness in planning for natural disasters. 
Retweet if you agree‚Üí Taxpayer funds should not be used to support abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. Pleased to see @POTUS‚Äôs ‚ÄúProtect Life Rule‚Äù amend Title X to protect the unborn. 
W&amp;M is working on a #bipartisan basis to combat the #opioidcrisis. This is not a partisan issue. Ensuring our communities and families are able to overcome this crisis is a shared priority. Learn about our bipartisan bills ‚¨áÔ∏è 
We‚Äôve lost 630,000 Americans to overdoses since 2000. We're in the midst of an #OpioidEpidemic. The House will soon consider more than 60 bills to combat this epidemic because we can‚Äôt let opioids continue to ravage our communities. More from @GOPLeader: 
Today, the House passed two critical pieces of bipartisan legislation‚Äîcontinuing our work toward improving the lives of Americans. We look forward to sending #RightToTry and financial regulatory reform to the @WhiteHouse. 
Breaking news‚Üí The House just voted to free our economy from overregulation. Main Street banks are engines of growth, and now it will be easier for these banks to lend to #SmallBiz and families. 
Great news‚Üí The House just passed a bill providing terminally ill patients with access to experimental treatments and therapies for the chance at a longer life. These patients‚Äîand their loved ones‚Äîdeserve the #RightToTry. 
The House just passed the Childhood Cancer #STARAct by voice vote, sending it to the President‚Äôs desk. This comprehensive childhood cancer bill brings us one step closer to delivering hope to #ChildhoodCancer patients and their families! &gt;&gt; 
After #TaxReform, for the first time in 17 years, over 65% percent of Americans believe now is a good time to find a quality job. They are right. 
Optimism about the economy is ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Wages are going ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Business investment is ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Utility bills are coming ‚¨áÔ∏è Let‚Äôs keep this momentum going. 
Small banks are the financial anchors of our communities. By making it easier for these banks to lend to Americans and #SmallBiz, we are unlocking more economic growth. 
This is a very busy week in the House: financial reforms, #RightToTry, and more legislation to rebuild our military. I‚Äôll be speaking about all the important bills we‚Äôre going to be sending to @POTUS live soon: 
This @FinancialCmte bill‚Üí ‚úî Provides regulatory relief for smaller banks ‚úî Enhances consumer protections ‚úî Improves #SmallBiz and middle-income families‚Äô access to credit Finally, Americans will get the financial relief they need. Learn more ‚Üì 
Community banks are being strangled by burdensome federal regulations, harming #SmallBiz, families, and our economy. Today, the House votes to restore common sense and financial opportunity all across the country. 
May is #NationalFosterCareMonth. Met with @CaseyPrograms last week to learn more about their efforts to strengthen the family unit to ensure the safety and success of every child. 
Congress has successfully repealed 16 burdensome, Obama-era regulations. We are delivering on our promise to scale back the size of government. 
Today, @POTUS signed this bill into law, eliminating this burdensome, auto lending regulation from the books. 
67% of Americans believe now is a good time to find a good-paying job‚Äîthe highest percentage in 17 years. Our thriving economy means more job openings and more opportunities for families to get ahead. 
Always great to meet with Wisconsinites in Washington. Last week, I talked about the benefits of #TaxReform with these Wisconsin realtors and manufacturers. 
Last week, we passed 32 bills out of the Energy Commerce Cmte to combat the #opioidcrisis. We have now advanced a total of 5Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ bills to help people who are struggling because of this epidemic in IN across the country. Read more ‚¨áÔ∏è 
More great economic news this week: - Jobless claims near 4Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£-year low - 7Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£% of manufacturers increasing wages or benefits - 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£% increase in capital expenditures. - 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Pennsylvania utility companies lowering rates 
The unemployment rate is continuing to drop and Americans are becoming increasingly optimistic about finding a good-paying job. This is great news. 
Retweet to let our law enforcement officers know they do not fight alone. We are with you, and behind you, this #NationalPoliceWeek and always. 
RT if you agree that #SNAP recipients deserve opportunities! With 6.6M open jobs, there has never been a better time to look for a job. The #2018FarmBill will bridge the gap for SNAP recipients to help them find work to support them and their households. 
.@ConawayTX11 and #HouseAg have paved the groundwork for a strong #2018FarmBill that benefits all Americans. It is time to stand with #ruralAmerica and #SNAP recipients and pass H.R. 2. 
Tax reform helped create a strong economy with a record number of open jobs, which is why now is a great time to help people move from welfare to work. That‚Äôs why passing the #2018FarmBill is so critical. 
What is WRDA? Why does it matter? The Water Resources Development Act authorizes America's water infrastructure - a critical aspect of our economic competitiveness and development. Join us to learn why #WRDAWorks for America. 
Manufacturers making things right here in America are hiring, expanding, and increasing workers' wages. This is more great #TaxReform news! 
There‚Äôs a lot of good news out there: ‚Üí Americans' satisfaction with the direction of our country: 13-year high ‚Üí Jobless claims: near 48-year low ‚Üí Retail sales are up for the 2nd month ‚Üí Industrial production is up for the 3rd straight month 
A thriving economy means more job openings. There is no better time to take action to help people join our workforce. The #2018FarmBill will help Americans move off of the sidelines and into a steady job. 
We‚Äôre running through the tape, making progress on the things that matter most in people‚Äôs daily lives. I‚Äôll speak about why the #2018FarmBill is so critical, yesterday‚Äôs passage of VA reforms, and our thriving economy live soon: 
It‚Äôs crazy this is even a debate, but I‚Äôm glad that I was able to clear up earlier that it‚Äôs obviously #Laurel, not Yanny. Everyone can agree. 
Breaking news ‚Üí The House just passed the bipartisan VA MISSION Act, which funds the Veterans Choice Program and establishes a streamlined community care program. No veteran should be without access to quality care. 
VIDEO: @RepTrey, @RepMiaLove, @RepTipton, @RepFrenchHill and @RepSeanDuffy have worked to get bills that help #smallbiz and community #financial institutions through the House of Representatives ‚¨á 
Retail sales are ‚¨Ü Unemployment rate is ‚¨á And right now, we have one open job for nearly every unemployed person in America. 
To all the cops on the beat, and to your loved ones: You do not fight alone. We are with you, and behind you, always. This #NationalPoliceWeek, we remember the 360 fallen officers we lost this past year and say "thank you" to all of the men and women who wear the uniform. 
The House has prevailed in a battle over the separation of powers. In a case that began under President Obama, today's result has preserved that only Congress, not the executive branch, can authorize spending. It is an important outcome for this institution. 
The House will vote on the #2018FarmBill this week. It funds education and training programs and includes work requirements to help get people out of poverty and on to the ladder of opportunity. 
Our economy is thriving. Right now in America, it‚Äôs a good time to be a worker or a job seeker. Learn more: 
Too many police officers lost their lives in the line of duty this past year. Today, we welcomed their friends, families, and fellow officers to the Capitol for the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service. We will never forget the sacrifice of these brave men and women. 
Honored to join @POTUS, the law enforcement community, families of our fallen for the annual #PeaceOfficersMemorialDay service today. Our courageous law enforcement officers sacrifice every day to keep our communities safe. WATCH LIVE: #PoliceWeek 
Today, the @USCapitol flags are lowered to half-staff in honor of our country‚Äôs law enforcement who have given their lives in the line of duty. We are forever grateful for their service and sacrifice. 
Harry Reid has never been one to shy from a fight, and this is surely no different. My thoughts are with Harry and his family today. 
So pleased her procedure was successful. Wishing @FLOTUS a full and speedy recovery. 
Learn more about what‚Äôs on the docket this week 
This #NationalPoliceWeek, we‚Äôll also vote on three bills to support our country‚Äôs law enforcement by providing resources needed to prosecute sexual assault crimes, encouraging police and community alliances, and more. 
The @DeptVetAffairs needs to be refocused toward effectively serving our nation‚Äôs heroes. That‚Äôs why this week, the House will vote to fund the Choice program, ensuring our #veterans have access to quality care, and extend the Post-9/11 Caregiver program. 
We should be empowering Americans to reach their full potential. The #2018FarmBill promotes work requirements for federal benefits and invests in education skills training programs. We want to help people flourish and this approach has been proven successful at the state level. 
From the #2018FarmBill to reforms to the @DeptVetAffairs and legislation protecting our country‚Äôs law enforcement officers, it‚Äôs another busy week in the People‚Äôs House. 
Whether they‚Äôre in kilts or caps, a big thank you to the United States Capitol Police, who protect and serve each and every day. We honor all of you this #NationalPoliceWeek. 
It‚Äôs crucial we empower Americans to achieve their own American Idea. That‚Äôs why the #2018FarmBill ties work requirements to federal benefits and invests in skills training vocational programs to help workers become qualified or retrained for good jobs. 
Today, more than five decades after the reunification of Jerusalem, this holy city will be home to our embassy. This is concrete affirmation of America‚Äôs commitment to the Jewish state and her people. America stands with Israel in recognizing Jerusalem as its eternal capital. 
I was 16 when my dad died, and my mom had to go back to school. The work ethic and courage she displayed to make a life for herself and for us was so inspiring. She is my hero. 
My mom is my hero. Happy #MothersDay, mom! 
To my mom Betty, my wife Janna, and all of the moms out there: Happy #MothersDay! 
Tomorrow is #MothersDay. Do not forget to call your moms! Maybe make a meal. Send some flowers. Or both. Don‚Äôt forget! 
#HouseAg highlights how work helps lift work-capable #SNAP recipients out of poverty. #2018FarmBill WATCH full video: 
Welcomed @AIPAC National Council Members to the office this week to discuss next week's opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem and ways in which we can continue to combat Iran‚Äôs regional aggression. 
The good economic news keeps coming in: 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£.8Ô∏è‚É£% increase in hiring last month 6Ô∏è‚É£.5Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ million open jobs 3Ô∏è‚É£. 4Ô∏è‚É£% increase in disposable income 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£.8Ô∏è‚É£: #SmallBiz optimism index near record high 
Our goal is to interrupt the multi-generational traps of poverty. Government should empower people to achieve their own American Idea. We want to give people hope: You can make it. You can be who you want to be. 
The last time unemployment was this low 3.9% was 2000 and there were 17M people on #SNAP. Today, there are 42M people on SNAP. The #2018FarmBill offers the work-capable individuals on SNAP the opportunity to improve their futures through skills and education training. 
Great news‚Üí This bill repealing another burdensome Obama-era regulation that's hurting consumers in the auto lending marketplace is off to the @WhiteHouse. 
With our current approach to the War on Poverty, we‚Äôre telling Americans: ‚ÄúYou're stuck in your current station in life and the government is here to help you cope with it.‚Äù We need to rethink this because it‚Äôs completely antithetical to the American Idea. 
Job openings are at an all time high. There are as many jobs open as there are people looking for one. Now, we must focus on getting people the skills they need to get hired for these jobs. 
We can solve America‚Äôs welfare crisis by being bold on welfare reform. Watch this conversation with @KayColesJames and @SpeakerRyan 
‚úÖ Lowest unemployment level since 2000 ‚úÖ Jobless claims near a 48-year low ‚úÖ #SmallBiz optimism at record highs ‚úÖ Business investment up 24% over the last year ‚úÖ Increased wages Following #TaxReform, the good economic news is everywhere you look.

There is good economic news everywhere you look. I‚Äôll soon be speaking about how American workers and families are finally getting ahead. Tune in: 
Iran‚Äôs aggression inside Israeli territory merited a forceful response. These actions demonstrated Iran's dangerous behavior capability have expanded significantly. This is evidence that we must maintain a robust presence in the region to counter roll back Iranian aggression. 
Yesterday, @Heritage President @KayColesJames and I sat down to discuss measuring success on the ‚ÄúWar on Poverty.‚Äù We firmly believe we should measure results‚Äîhow many people have pulled themselves out of poverty‚Äîinstead of how much we spend or how many programs we have. 
Unemployment is at an 18-year low, wages are climbing, and economic growth remains strong. But employers are struggling to recruit skilled workers to fill job vacancies. We must find ways to get people off of the sidelines and into these jobs. 
Had a productive meeting with @USAmbCanada Kelly Craft about improving #NAFTA to ensure the best deal for American workers and our economy. And representing America‚Äôs Dairyland, we need to ensure a fair trading environment for our country‚Äôs dairy industry. 
The #2018FarmBill provides states options and flexibility to best service #SNAP recipients in their states. 
Met with @AmbDermer today to discuss @POTUS‚Äôs recent decision to withdrawal from the Iran Deal. We also discussed regional issues and how the United States and Israel can work together to contain Iranian expansion. 
MEC is a classic small-town company, located in California‚Äôs Central Valley, that‚Äôs making boom and scissor lifts right here in America. Because of #TaxReform, they‚Äôve awarded bonuses to all of their workers, matched 401(k) contributions, and are creating more jobs. 
Great to call into @620wtmj, based in Milwaukee, to talk about the Iran Deal, entitlements, and today‚Äôs very positive development out of North Korea. 
From @SpeakerRyan: Opportunity Zones: Help for Distressed Communities Is on the Way Thanks to Tax Reform. 
.@POTUS and @SecPompeo securing the release of the three American detainees from North Korea is terrific news. While this is a gesture of goodwill, we must remain clear-eyed about the true nature of the regime. 
Today, the president submitted the largest rescission package in history, and the House will soon pass it. This is an important effort to revive a budget-cutting tool that has been ignored for too long. 
On #TeacherAppreciationDay and every day we are thankful for the millions of teachers across the country who inspire America‚Äôs students to be their best. 
Great news‚Üí The House just voted to relieve Americans‚Äîand our economy‚Äîof yet another Obama-era regulation, this time, making things easier for consumers in the auto lending marketplace. 
For decades, former Speakers of the House have been provided an official government office after leaving Congress. Asking taxpayers to foot this bill is not something I‚Äôm willing to do. I fully support @HouseAppropsGOP's legislation to eliminate all funding for former speakers. 
From the beginning, the Obama-era Iran Deal was deeply flawed. My full statement ‚Üì 
With the help of Acting @BCFPDirector Mulvaney, we‚Äôre reigning in the most powerful least accountable govt agency @CFPB. This time, we're working to stop their auto-lending power grab that is harmful and costly to consumers. The House votes on this today. 
This is great news! In the months following #TaxReform, there are 6.6 million job openings‚Äîa record high. Our economy is growing and we now need to make sure Americans get the skills they need to obtain these jobs. 
Our economy is thriving. #TaxReform is helping bring an end to years of economic uncertainty and stagnation. Now, we need to make sure Americans have the right skills to get a good-paying job. 
People are seeing more money in their paychecks and retirement accounts. Businesses are expanding and hiring. Unemployment is the lowest it‚Äôs been in 18 years. Our economy is thriving. 
Just five months ago, Washington Democrats were saying #TaxReform would mean ‚Äúthe end of the world.‚Äù Now the economy is thriving. I‚Äôll be speaking more about the strength of our economy live soon: 
Breaking news‚Üí Just swore in the newest member of the House of Representatives, Rep. Debbie Lesko from #Arizona. 
Tax reform delivers again... just in time for the hot Alabama summer! Last week @alabamapower announced it will reduce customers‚Äô bills by $257 million this year -- that‚Äôs 1.4 million Alabamians who will now be paying less for utilities each month. 
Unelected bureaucrats can harm the very consumers they intend to protect with burdensome regulations. This week, the House will use the Congressional Review Act to eliminate yet another Obama-era regulation that‚Äôs hurting jobs and stifling economic growth. 
Americans in 48 states, including California, are set to see lower utility bills because of #TaxReform. With summer right around the corner, this is great news for Valley families. 
Opportunity Zones "can be the difference between an America where too many get left behind" and one where Americans are empowered to achieve the American Idea. Pleased this poverty fighting tool is now the law of the land. 
We are kicking off Teacher Appreciation Week! Join us in celebrating all the hard-working teachers in our lives. Tell us about your favorite teacher using #ThankATeacher. 
48 States, including Michigan, seeing lower utility bills following tax reform 
Following the passage of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, utility companies in 48 out of 50 states, and DC, have taken action to pass their federal tax savings on to their 87 million customers. 
Well said, @SenatorTimScott. Opportunity Zones are a critical component in fighting poverty, and thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they are now the law of the land. 
This week‚Äôs #TaxReform good news: 3Ô∏è‚É£.9Ô∏è‚É£% unemployment rate (lowest in nearly 20 years) 3Ô∏è‚É£.2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£% hourly wage growth for #SmallBiz workers in April 8Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ million Americans are to see lower utility bills 
Great news‚Üí At 3.9%, the unemployment rate is at it‚Äôs lowest level in nearly 20 years. With #TaxReform, the (work)force is gaining strength. #MayThe4thBeWithYou 
Following #TaxReform, 87 million Americans‚Äîand counting‚Äîacross 48 states (+DC) are set to see lower utility bills. This is a big deal for so many families. 
Faith-based organizations do important work in their communities and deserve a stronger voice in solving the challenges we face. By learning from and supporting their efforts, we can empower more Americans to lift themselves out of poverty. 
Utility companies in 48 out of 50 states, and DC, have taken action to pass their federal tax savings on to their customers: via @SpeakerRyan 
Great report from @CNBC on the impact that the tax law is already having on small manufacturers. #ItsWorking. 
Utility companies in 48 states have taken action to pass their federal tax savings on to their customers. That‚Äôs more than 87 million Americans across the country who are set to see lower utility bills because of #TaxReform. 
GOOD READ: ‚ÄúSmall business workers saw their wages grow at the strongest rate in 2 years: Survey‚Äù via @CNBC ‚¨áÔ∏èhttps://t.co/NYXpThfUDG 
.@SpeakerRyan commended the positive economic impact of #TaxReform on small businesses. #SmallBusinessWeek 
Great news for Alabama! The Public Service Commission announced that @alabamapower customers will see lower bills over the next 2 years due to the tax overhaul. I'm encouraged by the many positive developments we‚Äôve seen thanks to the Tax Cuts Jobs Act. 
Last month, #SmallBiz employees saw their wages grow at the strongest rate in more than two years. Small Business owners are saying #TaxReform has been a ‚Äúgame changer.‚Äù The new tax code is already helping Main Street thrive. 
#SmallBiz are the backbone of our economy and we finally have a new tax code that promotes this entrepreneurship. #TaxReform has allowed these business to create jobs and drive growth in our communities. 
BREAKING: Georgia family-owned manufacturer lands largest contract in company history, credits tax reform for "creating more business." 
Today is the first day of May. I‚Äôll spare you the May jokes and memes and instead, share with you some of my favorite moments from last month 
Column: ‚ÄòOpportunity Zones‚Äô on their way via @detroitnews @RepFredUpton 
Millions of Americans live in these distressed communities, and they‚Äôre being left on the sidelines simply because of their zip code. By setting up Opportunity Zones, we‚Äôre empowering individuals to realize their own independence. 
Pockets of the country are in desperate need of revitalization. Opportunity Zones encourage investors to pour capital into these distressed areas to encourage long-term economic growth. Think entrepreneurship, charter schools, and job training programs. 
ICYMI: The new tax law included Opportunity Zones‚Äîa component of our poverty fighting agenda that boosts economic growth and job creation in distressed communities nationwide. 
This is what tax reform is all about ‚Üí helping taxpayers, especially middle-income families small businesses, put more money in their pocket so they can choose what to do with it. #SmallBusinessWeek ‚Ü¥ 
Happy National #SmallBusinessWeek to our nation's 30 million small businesses, entrepreneurs, and innovators. When America's small businesses are strong ‚Äì America is strong. On this small biz week, be sure to shop small! 
It‚Äôs no secret that Wisconsin is known for its beer. Enjoyed meeting with the Wisconsin Beer Distributors Association this week to discuss the benefits #TaxReform is having on its industry and workers. 
Prescription drugs can be just as dangerous as street drugs when taken without a prescription or a doctor‚Äôs supervision. Proper disposal of unused drugs saves lives. Visit for a collection site near you. #TakeBackDay 
I congratulate President Moon on the inter-Korean summit, and look forward to specific and demonstrable actions from North Korea that show the regime‚Äôs commitment to real and verifiable change. In the meantime, the maximum pressure campaign should not be relaxed. 
From the ability to purchase new equipment to help their companies expand to increasing school programs that promote manufacturing, #TaxReform is already benefitting these made-in-Wisconsin businesses. 
Today‚Äôs overwhelming bipartisan passage of the FAA reauthorization is the next step in rebuilding America‚Äôs infrastructure. This bill will allow our aviation industry to make important improvements, making air travel safer for families allow our manufacturers to better compete. 
Americans and businesses alike are becoming more confident in the outlook of our economy following #TaxReform. With record numbers of jobless claims and increased wages, the tax law is bringing positive changes for American workers and their communities. 
But my favorite part of the day was when one of my own kids came to work with me, along with his whole 8th grade class from Janesville. 
I met with a lot of really smart (and well-dressed) kids today. Love seeing so many participate in #TakeYourChildToWorkDay. 
Great meeting with @BetsyDeVosEd today. We are laser-focused on equipping America‚Äôs students with the skills they need to succeed. 
.@RepBradWenstrup is a hero. Today, the Army awarded him the Soldier‚Äôs Medal for his heroic actions during the shooting at the Congressional Baseball game practice. Colonel Wenstrup, there is no one more deserving of this recognition. 
Today is a day I look forward to each year‚ÄîTake Your Children to Work Day. Started the day off right by welcoming my staff‚Äôs daughters and sons to the Capitol. 
Told the junior members of the press corp this morning that the work their parents are doing‚Äîupholding and protecting the First Amendment‚Äîis really important for our country. They should be very proud. 
Our country‚Äôs infrastructure is in dire need of updates. This year‚Äôs #FAA reauthorization funds critical airport projects, makes air travel safer and easier, makes the airline industry more competitive, and provides much-needed disaster relief. 
It‚Äôs "Take Your Children to Work Day!" Looking forward to soon welcoming all of the junior members of our press corp to my weekly press conference. Tune in live: 
Updates to our country‚Äôs #infrastructure are long overdue. This year‚Äôs #FAA reauthorization ‚Ü¥ ‚úîÔ∏èRestores US aviation industry competitiveness ‚úîÔ∏èEnhances flight safety ‚úîÔ∏èStrengthens disaster relief ‚úîÔ∏èResponsibly integrates unmanned aircraft systems 
The historic U.S.-France alliance is as strong as ever. 
Thank you, @EmmanuelMacron, for coming to Congress to speak about the shared values between the U.S. and France. 
Welcome to the @USCapitol, President @EmmanuelMacron! 
President @EmmanuelMacron of the French Republic is addressing a joint meeting of Congress. 
Live soon, President @EmmanuelMacron of the French Republic will deliver an address to a joint meeting of Congress. Tune in: 
It is an honor to welcome President @EmmanuelMacron to the Capitol. Our republics must always stand together when our shared interests and values are at stake. Today‚Äôs joint meeting is another step in strengthening this historic alliance even further. 
Later today I‚Äôll be in WI where 28K workers have gotten a raise or bonus in the past 4 months thanks to @POTUS, @SpeakerRyan all of WI‚Äôs GOP in Congress who helped pass the largest tax cut reforms in U.S history. Read my op-ed in the @JournalSentinel: 
Our tax bill was written with #SmallBiz in mind. For Kevin, #TaxReform has allowed him to reinvest in his hauling company by purchasing new trucks and equipment. He also plans to soon expand, which will create more jobs. 
Welcomed @WTO Director-General Roberto Azev√™do to the Capitol last week. We had a productive discussion about how to improve global trade rules to ensure free and fair trade. 
In case you missed it, @SpeakerRyan, @RepKevinBrady and I recently sat down with small business owners to hear how the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct has helped their employees and families. Check out what they had to say: 
My final stop today was at Vision Plastics in Delavan, Wisconsin. #TaxReform has allowed this family-owned, custom injection molding business to expand by purchasing new equipment. 
Next stop on my tax reform tour in Wisconsin today ‚Üí Adams Electric, a family owned and operated business that is hiring and training young workers to be the next generation of electricians. 
Tax reform isn‚Äôt just helping American job creators and workers. It‚Äôs also helping our students. Manufacturers like Palmer Hamilton in Elkhorn, WI, are partnering with local middle high school tech programs to train tomorrow‚Äôs workforce with the skills needed for a good career. 
Wisconsin is first in the nation for manufacturing jobs added in 2018. At home in Janesville this morning, these AMTEC workers showed me how they are also helping provide our military with state-of-the-art equipment. 
Optimism amongst #SmallBiz owners is at a record high. Following #TaxReform, John has been able to create more jobs and give raises to his workers. The optimism has spread to his workers, who are now seeing more money in their paychecks. 
Ed Lorenzen was a fellow budgeteer and a father. Just a great guy. In January, Ed and his 4-year-old son died in a fire. His family is going through the unthinkable right now. Please keep them in your prayers. 
Always enjoy meeting with Wisconsinites who have come out to Washington. Thanks for stopping by the office this week! 
#TaxReform has given some businesses the confidence they need to expand. Debra recently took the risk of opening up another location for her business, which will also allow her to create at least 10 more jobs. 
American businesses are using their tax savings to reinvest in their workers. #TaxReform has allowed Dave‚Äôs trucking company provide wage increases for its drivers, as well as increase its contribution to employees‚Äô health plans. 
Because of #TaxReform, 90% of workers will see more money in their paychecks. At our #TaxTalk earlier this week, Kasey told @RepKevinBrady, @CathyMcMorris, and me that she‚Äôs using her increased monthly pay to complete her education. 
House Republicans are continuing to make good on the agenda we promised in 2016: ‚úÖ Historic #TaxReform ‚úÖ Rebuild of our military ‚úÖ Regulatory relief And we‚Äôre not done: workforce development, #Infrastructure, and combatting the #OpioidCrisis 
Today, we hosted a memorial service in the Capitol to honor Rep. Louise Slaughter. The first woman in history to chair the Rules Committee, Louise was a pioneer. She will be missed around these halls. 
Great news‚Üí The House just passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan, comprehensive overhaul of the IRS. This restoration of oversight, fairness, and accountability puts customer service at the forefront of the agency. 
For too long, vague and unenforceable requirements have discouraged work and left many good jobs unfilled. The #2018FarmBill includes much-needed reforms that will strengthen America‚Äôs workforce and help people move out of poverty. 
There are currently 6.1 MILLION open jobs in the U.S. It's time to help our neighbors in need get the training they need to fill those positions and reach a higher standard of living. #SNAPmatters #2018FarmBill 
The #2018FarmBill establishes opportunities for our work-capable #SNAP recipients. Anyone receiving SNAP will be guaranteed a spot through E&amp;T. It's time to offer the hope of a job and a skill and a better future for themselves and their families. #SNAPmatters 
After Tax Day ‚Äì with the frustration of dealing with the IRS fresh in our minds ‚Äì now is the perfect time to vote on legislation that will redesign the IRS to put the #TaxpayerFirst. 
Watch LIVE: @SpeakerRyan, @cathymcmorris and @RepKevinBrady hold a #TaxTalk roundtable to highlight stories of everyday Americans who are benefiting from the new tax law. 
First Lady Barbara Bush was a force who loved her family and our country passionately. The flag at the @USCapitol flies at half-staff to honor a woman who so many Americans revere. 
It‚Äôs high time we restore oversight, fairness, and accountability to the IRS. Today, we‚Äôll vote to return customer service to the forefront of the IRS‚Äôs mission. 
This ends today. The House will soon take action on a pair of bipartisan initiatives that will be the biggest and boldest step in 20 years to redesign the IRS. One bill strengthens the security of the agency‚Äôs IT systems. The other shifts power back to the taxpayer. 
The IRS is in dire need of a comprehensive overhaul to restore a taxpayer-first focus. For years, its fell short of the standards needed to protect people‚Äôs data and privacy‚Äînot to mention its political targeting scandal. 
Barbara Bush holds a revered place in the hearts of generations of Americans. She so loved her family and our country. She led both with clarity and character. To Mrs. Bush‚Äôs family, I extend the deepest condolences of the whole House. May she rest in eternal peace. 
The new tax code was written with everyday families and #SmallBiz in mind. Enjoyed sitting down with @RepKevinBrady, @RepCathyMcMorris, and these taxpayers to hear how their families and businesses are already benefitting from #TaxReform. 
Today is the first #TaxDay in years that #smallbiz have received some good news. Compensation is up, sales are strong, #taxes received the fewest votes as #smallbiz‚Äôs #1 problem since 1982. 
We know all of the anxieties and stresses associated with #TaxDay, but we have good news ‚Üí this is the last time you‚Äôll file under this current burdensome tax code, thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. 
Our #TaxTalk is live! We‚Äôre enjoying hearing how these Americans are already benefitting from m#TaxReform. 
Soon, @CathyMcMorris and @RepKevinBrady will join me for a #TaxTalk with everyday Americans who are benefiting from the new tax law. Tune in: 
What does the new tax code mean for working families? As @SpeakerRyan put it in his new op-ed: "...more money and less hassle." 
Under our new tax code, the typical family of four will see a tax cut of $2059. With a nearly doubled standard deduction and a doubled child tax credit, that‚Äôs going to make a big difference in people‚Äôs lives. 
Not only was #ANWR a victory for the people of Alaska, all Americans will benefit from increased domestic energy production. #AmericaFirst #TaxDay 
There are countless ways that the #TaxCutsandJobsAct will be better than our old and outdated tax code. Here are our the top 5... 
Today is the last #TaxDay with our old tax system. Under the new code, American families will see: ‚úÖ An average tax cut of $2059 ‚úÖ Lower tax rates ‚úÖ Nearly doubled standard deduction ‚úÖ Doubled child tax credit 
This is the last #TaxDay under the old code‚Äîa system full of hassle and riddled with loopholes for the well-connected. When you file your taxes next year, that won‚Äôt be the case. 
Today, we move forward with a new tax code, one that means new possibilities for people across this country. @HouseGOP leaders will soon discuss how #TaxReform is already making our country stronger. Watch live: 
OPINION: Speaker Paul Ryan: Tax Day isn't usually a day to celebrate. This year is different 
Kicking off #TaxDay with @SquawkCNBC, talking about how this new tax code is already helping hardworking American families. Tune in to @CNBC live at 8AM. 
@BizRoundtable @cathymcmorris @CFPBDirector @stevenmnuchin1 @WhipHoyer @SpeakerRyan @Perduesenate @GOPLeader @RepKevinBrady @ChrisVanHollen .@SpeakerRyan is live with us @ 8a ET. What do you want to know? 
Did you know, thanks to tax reform, $4 billion in bonuses have been given to hard-working Americans across the country? The good news doesn‚Äôt stop there. Recently, Kroger announced education benefits to its employees as a result of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. 
Enjoyed meeting with this great group of conservative leaders to discuss workforce development policies to help more Americans rise out of poverty. I also thanked them for their efforts in passing historic #TaxReform. 
Thinking of my friend @SteveScalise. We pray for his speedy recovery and look forward to having him back at work soon. 
Tomorrow is the LAST time you and your family will have to file taxes under a 32-year-old complicated tax code. Starting next year, Americans will pay taxes under a new, simplified tax code with lower rates, a nearly doubled standard deduction, and an expanded child tax credit. 
GOOD NEWS ‚Üí because of their savings from the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, @Kroger is hiring 11,000 employees in their stores all over America. 
Tomorrow is #TaxDay and the good news is this is the last year you will have to file using the old, broken code. Check out Chairman @RepKevinBrady‚Äôs op-ed in @USAToday ‚¨áÔ∏è 
Soon we will say‚Ä¶ goodbye and good riddance to our old and outdated tax code. #TaxDay 
Next year you won‚Äôt have to worry about filing under a complicated tax code. We made it simpler to save you time and headaches. 
More great #TaxReform news‚Üí 
RT if you‚Äôre excited to say goodbye to this 32-year-old tax code. 
How is @Verizon passing along their benefits from the #TaxCutsandJobsAct? Investing in our children. Verizon said they will double their support of #STEM education programs in schools that lack resources. ‚ûó Learn more ‚¨áÔ∏è 
Wishing our Sikh American friends and neighbors a happy #Vaisakhi! 
In coordination with our allies, the U.S. took decisive action against the Syrian regime. The regime‚Äôs unconscionable brutality against innocent civilians cannot be tolerated. Let us all pay tribute to the men and women of our armed forces. 
With #TaxReform working, 93.5% of manufacturers have a positive outlook for their company. Optimism amongst small manufacturers is at an all-time high. All of this means more jobs and higher wages. 
Another good week for America‚Äôs workers: ‚úÖ 400 franchise brands announced reinvestment in employees economy ‚úÖ @ShopFloorNAM survey found 93.5% of manufacturers have a positive economic outlook ‚úÖ Jobless claims fell by 9,000 #TaxReform is working. 
.@ConawayTX11 on getting #SNAP policy right: It‚Äôs about helping every citizen realize the American dream by modernizing a program that helps lift folks out of poverty, rather than trapping them there. #HouseAg #farmbill 
Here's an in-depth look at how the SNAP program helps the American Dream more attainable. From my desk to yours --&gt; 
We are just 5 days away from Tax Day. When you submit your tax returns this year, you‚Äôre saying goodbye to our old tax code for good. In it‚Äôs place is a code with lower rates, a nearly doubled standard deduction, and an expanded child tax credit. 
Today, we renew our commitment to never forget the men, women, and children, including six million Jews, who were senselessly murdered during the Holocaust. #HolocaustRemembranceDay 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. made America look up, and look within. By his works, we saw the great promise of the American Idea‚Äîan America where the condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life. #MLK50 
Congress will soon honor the late Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with a ceremony in the @USCapitol to observe the 50th anniversary of his assassination. Watch: 
The #2018FarmBill continues our work to help more Americans out of poverty and into the workforce by promoting apprenticeships and skills training programs. 
We are working on an agenda to help get people out of poverty, into the workforce, and on to the ladder of opportunity. It should always pay to work. 
In today‚Äôs economic environment, businesses are looking to hire. There are jobs for the taking. Soon, I‚Äôll be talking about the House‚Äôs efforts to develop our country‚Äôs workforce. Watch live: 
What are you proudest of as you get ready to retire? "A bulk of work which advanced a political philosophy that brings more growth and opportunity to focus on the American idea." -- @SpeakerRyan to @GayleKing 
COMING UP on @CBSThisMorning: @GayleKing will speak with @SpeakerRyan for his first in-depth, broadcast network interview since announcing his retirement from Congress 
TOMORROW: @SpeakerRyan will give his first in-depth, broadcast network interview since announcing his retirement from Congress to @GayleKing. The interview will be live from his Ceremonial Office in Washington. Watch @CBSThisMorning 7-9 a.m. 
.@SpeakerRyan: "Our majority's in good hands. @POTUS has given us this chance to get a lot done." @dailybriefing 
Productive discussion with the Emir of #Qatar today. I look forward to continuing to make progress together on a range of regional issues. 
I‚Äôm a Wisconsin guy who came to Washington to make a difference. I‚Äôm proud of all of we‚Äôve accomplished in Congress, and I‚Äôm ready to set new priorities. 
.@SpeakerRyan: "We've got a lot more work to do just this term." @dailybriefing 
"I always felt like a Wisconsin guy who came to Washington to Congress to make a difference." WATCH: @DanaPerino's full interview with @SpeakerRyan on @dailybriefing. 
I will be speaking to @SpeakerRyan at 2pm in his first one-on-one interview since making the announcement he will not seek re-election on @dailybriefing @FoxNews 
Serving as speaker has been a great honor. Now, with all three of my kids in their teens, I am ready to set new priorities. I intend to serve my full term as I was elected to do. But I will be retiring in January, leaving this majority in good hands and with a bright future. 
Serving as speaker has been one of my life‚Äôs great honors. I‚Äôm proud of all we‚Äôve done am ready for new prioritie‚Ä¶ 
I‚Äôm about to hold a press conference. Watch live: 
ICYMI: Congress has been cracking down on human trafficking. Looking forward to seeing the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act signed into law tomorrow! 
Congress has acted @SpeakerRyan has sent my bill, #FOSTA, to @POTUS' desk. This legislation gives federal, state, local prosecutors the tools they need to take down the websites selling our children with impunity. Tune in tomorrow for the bill signing. #EndHumanTrafficking 
This is one of the best economic environments in years, yet businesses are struggling to find qualified workers. @POTUS‚Äôs executive order on workforce development and economic mobility reaffirms that it‚Äôs time we face our poverty challenge head on. 
These are my (older) siblings: Stan, Janet, and Tobin. Happy #NationalSiblingsDay to them, and all the sisters and brothers out there. 
Good rundown from @SpeakerRyan on the work Congress has done to combat sex trafficking here in the US. Looking forward to seeing @POTUS sign this important legislation tomorrow. 
Perpetrators of sex trafficking have used bad actor websites like Backpage to expand their reach. Pleased to see legislation Congress passed to help authorities crack down on these websites start to take effect. 
This is great news. Even before #FOSTA is signed into law, authorities are taking action to crack down on the bad actor websites that have been enabling online sex trafficking. 
Inefficient environmental review processes have led to unnecessary delays, depriving American communities of critical #infrastructure projects. 
Major infrastructure projects can too easily get bogged down in bureaucracy. Reforms to the permitting process for these projects will go right at that logjam. 
The chemical attack in Syria is a horror that cannot be tolerated by responsible nations. The U.S. must continue to lead an international effort to hold the Assad regime and Russia accountable for their actions. 
5Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£+ companies are raising wages, paying bonuses, improving benefits, or lowering utility rates because of tax reform. 
Enjoyed discussing the benefits of #TaxReform at @SouthwestAir in Dallas and how we can help bring people off of the sidelines and into the workforce at @CCFortWorth earlier this week. Here are some of my favorite moments from Texas‚Üí 
.@SpeakerRyan visits Catholic Charities Fort Worth to "discuss workforce development and strategies for effectively helping Americans escape poverty and realize their American Idea." 
These are significant sanctions. I‚Äôm pleased the administration continues to use tools provided by Congress to hold Russia accountable for its destabilizing actions. 
Businesses are coming back to America from overseas because of #TaxReform. Our updated tax code means a stronger U.S. economy and the creation of more jobs. 
Broadcom is the latest company to join the list of companies relocating back to the U.S. from overseas because of #TaxReform. This is great news. 
Enjoyed my visit to @CCFortWorth, learning about the great work they‚Äôre doing to help lift people out of poverty. We must tap into the potential of our growing economy with policies that help bring people off of the sidelines and into the workforce. 
This week, Chairman @RepKevinBrady joined @SpeakerRyan in Dallas #TX to hear from @SouthwestAir employees about how #taxreform is helping them and their families. 
Martin Luther King Jr. was taken from us far too soon, but his work endures and his vision of liberty and opportunity for all inspires us still. Congress will soon honor Dr. King in the Capitol, where the civil rights legislation he fought for became a reality. 
Workforce Development: Speaker Ryan at Catholic Charities Fort Worth @CCFortWorth via @SpeakerRyan 
Washington‚Äôs one-size-fits-all approach isolates and marginalizes. We need to fix that. We need to renew our focus on community, and our obligation to one another, to help people make the most of their lives. Thank you to @CCFortWorth for having me. 
This is a beautiful story. Organizations like Catholic Charities are doing heroic work in our communities to fight poverty. This is among the keys to breaking the cycle, and getting more people into good-paying jobs. 
We have to help able-bodied adults get into the workforce. Make work pay. It should always make sense to take a step forward. It should always make sense to get a job. 
We need to focus our approach to fighting poverty and getting people into good jobs on what works locally. Break up the monopoly. Measure whether we‚Äôre actually helping people. Reward work. @CCFortWorth 
Tune in: I'm discussing solutions for effectively helping Americans escape poverty and realize the American Idea live at @CCFortWorth. 
I‚Äôll be continuing the workforce development conversation this morning at Catholic Charities Fort Worth. @CCFortWorth has done great work on getting people out of poverty and into good-paying jobs. Watch live at 11:45 am EThttps://t.co/RrNzrxPmYU 
In today‚Äôs economy, jobs are being created and wages going up. It‚Äôs time we help people get off of the sidelines and into the workforce‚Äîhelping Americans get the skills they need to obtain a good-paying job. 
Before #TaxReform, U.S. companies were becoming foreign companies because of our tax code. The tax cuts bill changed that. We're now seeing companies stay in America, hire in America, and bring their money back from overseas. 
Carla used her $1000 #TaxReform bonus to help take her mom on a beach vacation this year. Enjoy hearing these stories from @SouthwestAir employees. 
With our old tax system, American companies were at a huge competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors. Because of #TaxReform, we've helped level the playing field. 
Soon‚Üí @RepKevinBrady and I discuss the benefits of #TaxReform with @SouthwestAir employees in Dallas. Watch live: 
.@SouthwestAir is one of the hundreds of companies that's given employees bonuses as a result of the tax cuts bill. @RepKevinBrady and I will be speaking with employees about the benefits of #TaxReform live from Dallas at 4:30 pm ET. Tune in‚Üí 
Today, I wish you and your loved ones a blessed Easter. 
On this Easter Sunday, we reflect on a story of redemption and pray for all those around the world experiencing hard times. May the promise of Jesus‚Äôs Resurrection bring them hope. 
.@SecretService agents put their lives on the line every day. They deserve to be compensated for the hours they work, and not be barred because of mandated caps for salary and overtime pay. Recently, @SpeakerRyan signed my bipartisan bill that I authored with @RepElijahCummings. 
This Russian hacker broke our laws. His extradition was a key issue I raised in Prague, and I‚Äôm pleased that the Czech government came to this decision. 
From delivering an official address to the Czech Parliament in Prague to signing several important pieces of legislation, here are some of my favorite moments from March‚Üí 
To all our veterans who answered the call to serve in Vietnam, thank you. We will forever be grateful for your service and sacrifice. #VietnamWarVeteransDay 
The role of the United States in European security architecture remains central and irreplaceable. 
Very welcome news from one of my former employers, @McDonalds. 
Watch LIVE as President Trump delivers remarks on the Infrastructure Initiative: 
Great news ‚Üí Jobless claims are at the lowest level since 1973. ‚Ü¥ 
Strict overtime pay caps have led to retention and recruitment challenges for the @SecretService. This bipartisan bill ensures these hardworking men and women receive the overtime compensation they‚Äôve earned. 
‚úÖ More jobs. ‚úÖ Bigger paychecks. That‚Äôs the power of tax reform. 
Because of the tax cuts bill, #MadeInAmerica businesses can not only reward workers, but expand and become more competitive. 
Manufacturer Dixon Valve announces $1,000 in tax reform bonuses for employees. @SpeakerRyan visited there in October! 
Pleased to see Dixon Valve Coupling, a #MadeInAmerica business that I was able to visit last year, join the list of job creators who are giving their workers bonuses as a result of #TaxReform. 
The people of Guatemala should be the ones to choose their next president. The stakes are high: promoting transparency, shared prosperity, and combating corruption. For this reason, the @TSEGuatemala needs to certify all eligible presidential candidates by the Sunday deadline. 
Silence is complicity. Our children are listening. The time to speak out is now. 
Whether it is antisemitism in Pittsburgh, racism in Charlottesville, or the xenophobia and Islamophobia today in Christchurch, violent hate is on the march at home and abroad. We cannot stand by as mosques are turned into murder scenes. 
On behalf of Jill, myself, and all of the Bidens, our hearts go out to the community in Christchurch suffering from today‚Äôs senseless violence. Friday prayers for those who were gathered at their mosques has seen families torn apart by hate. 
No one should live in fear of being fired, evicted from their home, or denied service in a restaurant just because of their gender identity or who they love. The #EqualityAct is long overdue, and will ensure LGBTQ Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. 
As @JoeBiden said when he endorsed the Equality Act in 2015‚Äîand still believes to this day: ‚ÄúWe have to pass the federal nondiscrimination legislation. And we need to pass it now.‚Äù #EqualityAct 
Joe Boardman led @Amtrak through difficult times, taking over during the worst economic crisis since the Depression, and starting a modernization that will help deliver the 21st century rail system America deserves. My thoughts are with his wife Joanne and their family. 
Each year on International Women‚Äôs Day, we reaffirm the straightforward truth that achieving the goal of full and equal rights for women is essential to the success of all our nations. More on #IWD2019 here: 
Thank you to the bipartisan members of Congress who today introduced a #VAWA reauthorization, landmark legislation that provides life-saving services and help for survivors. 
@CynthiaNixon You‚Äôre right, Cynthia. I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn‚Äôt be given a silent reaction on the world stage. But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President.

Notes are ready. Be sure to tune in at 3pm ET when I will sit down at @UDBidenSchool with author and historian @jmeacham to talk about his book ‚ÄúThe Soul of America‚Äù and the state of our democracy today. 
Today we are celebrating the naming of the @UDBidenSchool. Over 250 guests are taking part in a series of luncheons highlighting the research and breadth of experience at the #UDBidenSchool 
Foreign election interference is not only a serious threat to our democratic institutions, it‚Äôs a threat to our national security. Russia and other authoritarian regimes are actively seeking to try to change outcomes of our democratic elections, and we can‚Äôt allow that to happen. 
The #PBC team is in Munich, Germany, with @JoeBiden for the @MunSecConf. Tune in to watch the livestream of his remarks at 3pm local/9am EST #MSC2019 
Today I congratulated President @IvanDuque on his successful visit to Washington. Maintaining strong bipartisan support for #Colombia is vitally important to meeting key security and economic challenges in the hemisphere, including humanitarian aid for refugees from #Venezuela. 
Stand with survivors and advocates like @nguyen_amanda, @ZerlinaMaxwell, @ruthmglenn, @DavidsonJess22, @Mariska, and so many others. Reauthorize VAWA now. 
There is nothing more powerful that Congress can do to help women, strengthen families, and save lives than reauthorizing VAWA. Now. 
VAWA‚Äôs power is that it gets stronger with each reauthorization. This year can be no different. Like was done in 2000 and 2005 and 2013, we must expand the reach of VAWA to respond to the needs of survivors at risk every day. 
One in five women will still be victims of rape or attempted rape in their lifetimes. On average, three women a day are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. Nothing is more urgent than reauthorizing and expanding the law that makes women safer. 
Since the passage of VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%. The National Domestic Violence Hotline responds to more than 26,000 people a month, creating a safety net for survivors. We have made progress, but there is much more to do. Right now. 
When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, I believed it would be a lifeline. But this Congress has turned it into a political football. It‚Äôs time to pass a strong reauthorization to the Violence Against Women Act. No more stalling. Lives are on the line. 
I know from personal experience the only way to overcome grief is to find purpose. The Parkland students families will not allow us to turn away from our responsibilities to those 17 fallen angels. We aren‚Äôt there yet, but with their determination insistence, we‚Äôll get there. 
One year after the tragic massacre in Parkland, we‚Äôve not done nearly enough to ensure this will never happen again. In the last year far too many have died from gun violence. But I have hope. #MSDStrong 
Only a tyrant would prevent the delivery of food and medicine to people he claims to lead. The international community must support Juan Guaido and the National Assembly. It is time for Maduro to step aside and allow a democratic transition. The Venezuelan people deserve better. 
John Dingell was the Dean of the House. He earned that title ‚Äî not just because he was there the longest ‚Äî but because he led with great moral courage and vision. He was a friend and I will miss him terribly. Debbie is in my prayers. 
Stacey Abrams achieved in a matter of minutes something Donald Trump failed to do in over an hour -- to embrace and give voice to the spirit and core values that make America great. 
Today far too many transgender youth continue to face rejection at home and discrimination in their communities. Check out the work @bidenfoundation is doing with @lgbtmap and @genderspectrum to support these young people: #AdvancingAcceptance 
There is no place for racism in America. Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now. 
This country is built on the courage of ordinary Americans who stand up for what‚Äôs right. I couldn‚Äôt be prouder to stand alongside the young leaders fighting tooth and nail to protect Title IX. 
Through the #HandsOffIX website, @endrapeoncampus,@knowyourIX have helped thousands make their voices heard in the notice and comment process. 
Fellow @UDelaware Blue Hen @Sage_Gaea of @knowyourIX has done so much for the students of Delaware through her advocacy, and is now fighting for students across the country. 
.@DavidsonJess22 of @endrapeoncampus has been advocating for safer campuses since long before I met her in the White House. Jess, I‚Äôm so grateful for your tireless work, and proud of all that you continue to accomplish. 
Students and survivors are making their voices heard. Grassroots organizers are working to make sure these guidelines are never put into effect. 
This week @bidenfoundation submitted a comment to the Department of Education about proposed changes to #TitleIX guidance. These new rules would endanger students and make it harder for survivors of sexual assault to seek justice. 
What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie. 
An untested rape kit means a survivor without justice. I wrote the first rape kit backlog law because every survivor deserves closure, and because evidence shows testing kits can identify men who have committed multiple rapes - and might again. Test every kit. Every single one. 
Yes, indeed @JoeBiden. We must take up the baton finish the work of reconstructing America. #PoorPeoplesCampaign 
Today we‚Äôre proud to release an #AsYouAre resource guide for LGBTQ+ youth and their parents, caregivers allies, featuring an animated short from @InstituteUMSSW at @mdsocialwork. Watch: 
The spirit of Dr. King is still with us. It has burrowed deep into the soul of this nation. It will not let us rest. On #MLKDay we must heed Dr. King‚Äôs admonition from his final sermon and do our part to ‚Äúmake America what it ought to be.‚Äù 
Congratulations, Brian! Proud to work with you at the White House; grateful for all that you have done for the LGBTQ community, we are fortunate for your continued leadership. 
Congratulations to the two women who led the way: @RepLonghurst and @HansenForSenate, as well as all of the lawmakers, activists, and citizens who made this happen. 
‚ÄúEquality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.‚Äù Another step forward for equality and basic dignity in Delaware tonight, as the Equal Rights Amendment is enshrined in our state‚Äôs Constitution. 
White supremacists and their shameful ideology should have no place in this country in 2019, let alone a voice of sympathy in the United States Congress. 
I know I‚Äôm a little biased, but this post from Jill @DrBiden in the #BidenForum is a must-read. Her story of the strong middle-class values that shaped her is America‚Äôs story. And she tells it so well. 
It is clear this administration has abandoned those core American beliefs. Secretary Mattis‚Äô presence and his voice of reason and experience will be missed in the Pentagon and the Situation Room. 
I‚Äôve had disagreements with Secretary Mattis, but we shared the view ‚Äî long-held by Democrats and Republicans in this nation ‚Äî that respect for our allies and a commitment to the most important and effective alliances in history made America safer. 
As we gather to count our blessings at the end of 2018, I'm grateful to those who believe everyone deserves a chance to work hard and build a good life for their families, no matter who their family is or where they come from. 
Joe is right. Head to before tomorrow‚Äôs deadline. And nice bracelet, by the way. 
Friends don't let friends go uninsured. If you still need health insurance for 2019, tomorrow, December 15th, is the last day to get it through This is about your health and peace of mind for you and your loved ones ‚Äî there's nothing more important. 
This summer, the @bidenfoundation asked you to share stories about the importance of family and community acceptance for #LGBTQ young people. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôve said so far: 
Now that‚Äôs more like it. 
President George H.W. Bush was a decent, kind, and gracious statesman. This nation will miss him. Our condolences go out to the entire Bush family for their loss. 
Grateful for the time spent with loved ones this Thanksgiving, and grateful for the sacrifice of those military families whose loved ones are on duty, unable to be with their families. From our family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. 
Betsy DeVos‚Äô new Title IX rules will discourage sexual assault reporting and investigations. When 1 in 5 women experience sexual assault while in college, we can‚Äôt afford to go backwards. Share your views: 
The fires continue to burn in California, and our firefighters are among those who are losing everything. Right now, no matter where you live, you can help. Please give to support firefighters who have lost their homes to the wildfires: 
Instead of saying every legal vote should be counted in Florida, Republicans have adopted a strategy to discredit the process. It‚Äôs wrong ‚Äì and it‚Äôs dangerous. Count every single lawful vote. Count them fairly. Count them transparently. 
Congratulations to @kyrstensinema for a well-earned victory tonight. She‚Äôs going to do incredible work for Arizona. Credit to @MarthaMcSally as well for handling the results with true dignity and class. 
Every military family knows what it means to sacrifice. Every individual life and story matters. It is who we are as Americans. On #VeteransDay and every day we must stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us. 
This Veterans Day, we are grateful for the #WalkOfAmerica team and all they have done to raise awareness around veteran mental health needs. 
It‚Äôs the most fundamental American right: the right to vote ‚Äî and for your vote to be counted. Count all the votes in Florida, Georgia, and Arizona. Count them fairly. Count them transparently. 
There's still time to take this election into your own hands. Don't regret what you could have done‚Äîtake action right now: 
No better time to help get out the vote than right now‚Äîwhether you have a lunch break or a few hours to spare, take back our democracy at an event near you: 
So let's do this. Get out there and vote today. Here's an easy place to confirm where you can vote, check voting hours, and find out if you need to bring anything with you. It's time. 
Today is #ElectionDay, and this election is bigger than politics. Today we have a chance to reclaim our American ideals and take this country back. 
The work we began that night ten years ago in Grant Park is unfinished. If you still believe, as I do, that hope is more powerful than fear, then show up and vote. And bring five people with you. 
You don‚Äôt need to be a Vice President or a podcast star to to make a difference in this election. Volunteer now, knock on some doors, and make sure you show up to vote this Tuesday. 
Voting restrictions in Georgia weren‚Äôt meant to protect the sanctity of our vote, but to suppress turnout. I applaud the court rulings to overturn them and right these wrongs. We should be making voting easier, not harder. Now let‚Äôs prove nothing can stop us. Vote. 
The character of our country is on the ballot on Tuesday, but you still have a chance to make a difference today. Don't just vote -- volunteer on #TheLastWeekend. It's that important. 
I couldn‚Äôt be more excited to close out this election in Luzerne County PA on Sunday at a Get Out the Vote rally with my friends @Bob_Casey and @CartwrightPA. Join us: 
This Thursday evening I‚Äôll be in Lansing, Michigan to support @ElissaSlotkin, Debbie @Stabenow, @GretchenWhitmer and @Garlin. RSVP to join us: 
We can‚Äôt leave a single vote on the table, and we‚Äôve got to do everything in our power to re-elect fantastic public servants like Senator @clairecmc. So I'm heading to Missouri for a Get Out The Vote Rally tomorrow evening. Join us: 
I'm proud to support @Kelly4SouthrnIL. Brendan is tough, independent, and honest‚Äîthe kind of leader and public servant that Southern Illinois needs. I'm excited to head to his district for a get out the vote really tomorrow‚Äîget info and RSVP here: 
I'll be in Cedar Rapids tomorrow with @Abby4Iowa and @FredHubbell to rally Iowans around reclaiming our democracy. Let us know you'll be there: 
Ohio needs a champion‚Äîa Governor with a back bone‚Äîand that‚Äôs @RichCordray. He‚Äôs ready to fight for working families, and I‚Äôm ready to help him get elected. Join us in Youngstown tomorrow: 
We desperately need men and women of character in elected office. That's why next Tuesday, one week out from Election Day, I'm proud to join @tammybaldwin @Tony4WI at early vote rallies. RSVP here: Madison: Milwaukee 
Together, we can take this country back. That's why I'm heading to Hartford on Friday in support of @NedLamont and @JahanaHayesCT. Don't miss this: 
It‚Äôs on ALL of us to make sexual assault a thing of the past. Join @JoeBiden and @Alyssa_Milano‚Äîtake the #ItsOnUs pledge right now to commit to the work ahead: 
What an honor to be joined by @Alyssa_Milano on tonight‚Äôs #ItsOnUs student organizing call. Alyssa, your courage reignited a movement, and your continued advocacy inspires me every day. Thank you. 
This country has to come together. This division, this hatred, this ugliness has to end. 
Cancer patients own their data, not hospitals. #CountMeIn empowers patients to contribute their data for research. To find cures. We are changing the culture of cancer research ‚Äî sharing data, breaking down silos, and forming new collaborations. We can do this. 
Our basic American values are under assault. But we can take this country back if we show up and vote. That's why I'm heading to Las Vegas on Saturday at 7:30am for the first day of early voting. RSVP here to say you‚Äôll be there: #RiseNVote 
WATCH: Former Vice President @JoeBiden told @NorahODonnell that "absolutely, positively, without question" voter suppression is ongoing in the United States. (See more Thursday on @CBSThisMorning) 
20 years have passed since the murder of young Matthew Shepard. We've come a long way, thanks to organizations like @MattShepardFDN, but our work isn‚Äôt done. We cannot stop fighting until every LGBTQ young person is affirmed, supported, and safe. #MSF20 
Joe Tydings and I were both inspired by JFK RFK and their call to service. In the Senate, he lived up to their example with an ironclad commitment to fight the abuse of power and work to ensure that every American gets a fair shot. Joe made America better‚Äîhe will be missed. 
Jason - public service takes many forms, and bravely stepping forward today is exactly that. By sharing your story, you are saving lives. Others will get the help they need because of you. Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Diana, and True every step of the way. 
Dr. James Allison and Dr. Tasuku Honjo‚Äôs immunotherapy discovery uses our own body‚Äôs defenses to destroy cancer. Today‚Äôs @NobelPrize award is a significant leap toward ending cancer as we know it and paving the path to a cure. Congratulations and thank you. 
Stopped by @UDelaware and @Penn today for #NationalVoterRegistrationDay. You have the power to change the course of this country, but you have to get engaged. Register now. And show up to vote this fall. 
Macedonia will soon hold a referendum on whether to endorse a historic accord with Greece that will pave the way for NATO membership. Despite Moscow's unrelenting propaganda campaign, Macedonians alone must decide what future they want for their country. 
Let me give you one example. The incidence of breast cancer and colon cancer are higher in the African American community than others. #BidenCancerSummit 
When I first got involved, it was clear that there wasn't much data being shared. We have an enormous capacity to share data and speed up cures. #BidenCancerSummit 
The advancements being made in the early detection of cancer hold much promise ‚Äì one day we may be able to tell from a drop of blood that a cancer is developing before you even have symptoms. #BidenCancerSummit 
Hi folks, @JoeBiden here to answer some of your questions from the #BidenCancerSummit on our effort to end cancer as we know it. 
Today we are hosting the #BidenCancerSummit in Washington DC and in over 450 communities around the world to bring together patients and providers to commit to making real, practical changes in the lives of cancer patients and their families. Join us: 
On the 24th anniversary of #VAWA, we celebrate past successes and remember what more remains to be done: 
In the wake of darker moments in our history, our spirit has become mightier. The bonds that unite us have become thicker. Seventeen years after the 9/11 attacks, may we continue to live that legacy in our words and our deeds, every day. In America, we can overcome anything. 
Before we vote this fall in the most consequential election of any of our lifetimes, I want us to have a real discussion about what really matters: the fundamental issues that determine whether or not all of us are given a chance to live with dignity and to pursue opportunity. 
Inspiring words from @BarackObama today. A powerful reminder that it's on all of us to vote this fall if we want leaders who reflect the civility, character, dignity, and goodness of the American people. The stakes couldn't be higher, but Americans always rise to the occasion. 
If there was ever a time for a change of pace, it is now. I recommend giving Michael‚Äôs new podcast a listen. 
Organized labor is why we have a minimum wage in this country. It‚Äôs why we have the five-day work week. It‚Äôs why we have worker safety standards. It‚Äôs why we have a middle class in America. We owe them. 
Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales‚Äôs decision to end CICIG‚Äôs mandate represents a serious blow to anti-corruption efforts in the hemisphere. The US Administration should condition assistance on CICIG‚Äôs continued operation. 
I will be in Phoenix tomorrow to pay tribute to my friend John. If you are in town and would like to honor his legacy of service, please come out to the route to say one last farewell. 
John McCain was many things ‚Äì a proud graduate of the Naval Academy, a Senate colleague, a political opponent. But, to me, more than anything, John was a friend. He will be missed dearly. 
Leonard and Dody Boswell lived their lives in service to the people of Iowa, and for the last 63 of those years, in loving dedication to each other. We remember both of them today as they are laid to rest. 
We‚Äôre in the midst of an all-out assault on human dignity‚Äîyes, at the border, but also in the courtroom, in the classroom, and on the factory floor. 
Kofi Annan knew that human beings acting together could make the world better. He dedicated his life to that belief. He insisted that defending human rights and dignity were part of our responsibilities to one another. We are all better for his influence on our world. 
The team @LombardiCancer has just made a valuable database of brain cancer biomedical data freely available to researchers globally. We need efforts like this to advance progress against cancer. 
Aretha Franklin was so much more than a great entertainer. She inspired. She gave hope. She was part of the soul of the civil rights movement. We won't see her like again. 
In the time I have known him, John Brennan has never been afraid to speak up and give it to you straight. Revoking his security clearance is an act unbecoming of a President. If you think it will silence John, then you just don't know the man. 
Today we honor the memory of Heather Heyer, whose spirit we see in every person who stands up to reject hatred and bigotry. Make no mistake: this fight goes on. The battle for the soul of this nation rests with each of us, everyday. 
Paul Laxalt was the model for something all too rare in politics today: someone with whom you could disagree without being disagreeable. We were often on opposite sides of the debate, but he was my friend. He will be missed. 
LGBTQ young people should never have to face rejection from those who love them. Share your story with @bidenfoundation about the importance of family acceptance, because we all deserve to be safe, loved, and affirmed. #AsYouAre 
Our lunches together were a highlight of every week at the White House. Last week's trip to @DogTagBakery was no different. Happy birthday to my brother, my friend, @BarackObama. 
Honored to join @DrBiden and the remarkable men and women from @supportthewalk #WalkOfAmerica who remind us all of the debt of gratitude we owe those who have sacrificed so much to protect our freedom. 
I was honored to visit Colombia this week to engage with the country‚Äôs current and future leaders. I wish all of my friends in Colombia a future of prosperity and peace as they celebrate the 208th anniversary of their independence. 
Our president had the chance to confront an adversary who continues to attack our democracy our allies. He didn‚Äôt. Instead he offered distractions, moral equivalence, appeasement. This shameful performance doesn't represent the US or what we stand for: 
After our video chat a few months ago, I got to welcome @shaffer_cierra to DC this week for @USMC Sunset Parade. She battled against cancer‚Äôs odds and her resilience reminds us all that hope against this disease is real. #cancerFIERCE 
As we celebrate 242 years of freedom this week, we must never forget that democracy is not a given. Democracy demands diligence. Democracy demands engagement. And sometimes, democracy demands sacrifice of its citizens. 
Keep our eyes on the horizon - look to the future. Nothing is beyond our capacity as Americans. Happy #FourthofJuly from the Biden Family. 
We need more men like @terrycrews who will stand up and speak out. You‚Äôre helping change the culture, Terry. It matters. Thank you. 
Another shooting. Another night in America where a father, a wife, a friend, a neighbor won‚Äôt be coming home. We can‚Äôt accept this. It must end. Congress must act. Our hearts are with the #CapitalGazette 
It‚Äôs up to us, America. Speak out. Rise up. Be heard. The price to be paid for putting our values at risk must be clear. Now. And show up to vote this November‚Äîin numbers like we‚Äôve never seen. 
Advice and consent. Absent that‚Äîwhich we‚Äôve always had for nominees in election years in the past‚Äîwe shouldn‚Äôt move forward with hearings or a vote before the mid-term elections. 
I wish this Senate would force a consensus choice‚Äîas we did with Justice Kennedy‚Äîit no longer has the will. 
I wish this President would engage in conversations and nominate a consensus candidate. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done in the past. That‚Äôs what America needs and deserves. He won‚Äôt. 
I said a year ago we‚Äôre living through a battle for the soul of this nation. Now there can be no doubt. Roe, Obergefell, Fisher, and more‚Äîso many of our fundamental rights, freedoms, and liberties‚Äîand the rule of law‚Äîare all at risk. 
Inspired by the patients, families, clinicians, and researchers of @stjuderesearch I met earlier this month. They are making hope real. Join us and let us know about your #cancerFIERCE story. 
We don‚Äôt need to treat migrants from Central America with cruelty to strengthen US border security. We need personal, high-level engagement from the White House to press Northern Triangle leaders for progress and support to make their home countries prosperous and secure. 
A policy that separates young children from their parents isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúdeterrent‚Äù. It‚Äôs unconscionable. A policy that traumatizes children isn‚Äôt a bargaining chip. It‚Äôs abhorrent. 
For #FathersDay, we‚Äôre giving free access to our episode on Robert Hayden‚Äôs ‚ÄúThose Winter Sundays,‚Äù available at Watch now to hear @JoeBiden‚Äôs memories of his father and make sure to go home and thank your own. #thosewintersundays #thanksdad #dadsday

Sometimes, it‚Äôs the smallest kindness that can make the biggest difference. FIERCE Awards celebrate exceptional people doing incredible things. NOMINATE an individual or organization today: 
Parents: Important information on how to keep your kids safe this summer from @BeauBidenFdn. Review share. 
PEPFAR is one of the most successful, effective, and world-changing initiatives the United States has ever led. Now is not the time to pull back. We must finish the work we started to end the specter of AIDS. My op-ed with @bfrist. 
Jamie Dimon Warren Buffett's call to end quarterly guidance is an important step toward ending our nation's culture of short-termism. America's workers investors will all be better off with a system that rewards those who build for the long-term. 
GOP all-out assault on healthcare continues. First, they want to cut funding for CHIP. Now DOJ trying to end protections for pre-existing conditions. We have to fight back. 
Putin‚Äôs Russia invaded its neighbors, violated our sovereignty by undermining elections, and attacks dissidents abroad. Yet our President wants to reward him with a seat at the table while alienating our closest democratic allies. It makes no sense. 
Join us and follow the #WalkOfAmerica journey at @supportthewalk learn more about the entire team: (2/2) 
Joe and I checked in with the amazing military veterans of the #WalkOfAmerica team were so inspired to hear how they're doing on their three-month journey. (1/2) 
They may have murdered our heroes, but the dream still lives buried deep in our broken hearts. Fifty years after he was taken from us, Robert Kennedy still inspires. #RFK50 
Last year, Virginians showed up to elect leaders who believe health care is a right, not a privilege. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Virginians now have the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Don't ever question whether your vote matters -- it does. Show up. 
Looking forward to continuing my #AmericanPromiseTour in June and discussing ‚ÄúPromise Me, Dad‚Äù with these inspiring individuals. More information at 
Today, as we remember all the brave men women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, let's also honor their families who carry on their legacies of selflessness every day. 
Our men women in uniform are the heart, the soul, and the spine of this nation. Today we remember those among them who gave their lives for our freedom. As we honor their sacrifice, we must recommit to our sacred obligation to care for support the families they left behind. 
In a moment of crisis, Jason Seaman showed incredible courage. Running directly into gunfire to save his students‚Äô lives. What a hero. 
Today, the @OECD officially invited Colombia to become its 37th member. Congratulations to President @JuanManSantos and the people of Colombia for all the hard work you‚Äôve done to create a more prosperous and secure future for your country. 
It favors the powerful over the powerless and stacks the deck even further against working people. It's wrong. 
Yesterday‚Äôs Supreme Court decision was a huge blow to workers. It denies them the ability to take their employers to court if they're being cheated out of pay, forced to work in unsafe conditions, or sexually harrassed. 
Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, but too many LGBTQ Americans are still denied this basic right. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to announce a new inclusion initiative between @bidenfoundation and @YMCA. The work continues: 
Enough is enough is enough. Decent people have to take a stand. These are our children. 
Count me in, @De11eDonne. Proud to take a stand with you and the incredible athletes of @WNBA who are partnering with organizations like @ItsOnUs to empower women and girls everywhere. Folks, join us to take a seat take a stand: #WNBATakesAStand #itsonus 
Guys, if you see one of your classmates trying to take advantage of a woman who did not or could not consent, you must step in. #ItsOnUs to change this culture. 
Harry Reid is literally and figuratively a fighter. I‚Äôm looking forward to working with him again soon. My thoughts are with Harry, Landra, and their family as he recovers. 
On behalf of the whole Biden family, I‚Äôd like to offer our thoughts and best wishes to @FLOTUS for a swift and full recovery. 
Joined today @UDBidenInst by one of the most brilliant public servants I‚Äôve ever worked with: @ErnestMoniz. By investing in basic infrastructure, we have a tremendous opportunity to lead the world in clean energy. Watch our discussion here at 12pm: 
Free and fair elections are at the heart of liberal democracy. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve joined @AndersFoghr and Michael Chertoff to launch the Transatlantic Commission for Election Integrity‚Äîto fight back against Russia and those who would meddle in our elections. 
Today‚Äôs announcement that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal is a profound mistake. 
Our hearts ache for the families of the brave airmen of the Puerto Rico National Guard killed in this week‚Äôs crash in SC. Their service to their country‚Äîkeeping us safe overseas and helping rebuild after disasters at home‚Äîis a legacy worth never forgetting. 
Every person is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. But far too often LGBTQ youth in this country are not, even in their own homes. This is unacceptable. I‚Äôm proud to work with @cyndilauper on #TrueColorsDay and everyday to put it to an end. 
Cancer patients and their families deserve a system that puts saving lives above every other thing. With your help, we can make this happen. We can make hope real. We need you to stand up and join us in this effort. Answer the @bidencancer call to action: 
Testing rape kits should must be a national priority. I‚Äôm proud to have been interviewed for @Mariska‚Äôs @IAMEVIDENCEmov. We should all be committed to #EndTheBacklog. Let‚Äôs keep the pressure on: 
Tune in NOW to watch @JoeBiden, @ItsOnUs and more recognize the bravery of students who are leading the fight to end sexual assault. #BidenCourageAwards 
There was no one else quite like Barbara Bush. Jill and I ‚Äî and the entire Biden family ‚Äî send our heartfelt condolences to the Bush family and our prayers for comfort in a difficult time. 
Five years after an act of hate struck Boston, the thousands of acts of charity and compassion on #OneBostonDay remind us once again that America will always own the finish line. Proud of you, Boston - today and always. 
The United States should be leading on this issue. Improving transparency is one essential step to ending the pay gap between men and women. 
Dr. King was proof that the promise of America can beat so strongly in the heart of one person they can move this nation. We can all -- 300 plus million Americans -- honor Dr. King‚Äôs legacy by remembering that today. #MLK50 
Congratulations to @NovaMBB on tonight‚Äôs win, especially Delaware‚Äôs own Donte DiVincenzo! Always glad to see a Philly team take home a championship trophy 
I‚Äôm grateful to have the opportunity to continue the #AmericanPromiseTour in June and hear from so many more people. Information available at 
(1/3) Help me @bidenfoundation recognize our nation‚Äôs incredible #military kids thank them for the sacrifices they make to keep our nation safe! 
Cierra, you remembered the most important thing I had to say. You will beat this. And as I‚Äôve always said, if there are any angels in heaven, they are nurses. You‚Äôve got a great team of them there making sure you stay #cierrastrong. 
My mother often reminded me that ‚Äúbravery resides in every heart and some day it will be summoned.‚Äù Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame answered the call last Friday in France. Taking the place of a hostage and paying the ultimate price. His heroism and self-sacrifice must not be forgotten. 
At @UDBidenInst, we‚Äôre working on the pressing domestic policy challenges of our time. But we can't do it alone. I sat down earlier with our new Policy Board to discuss everything from quality jobs to climate change. Check out the whole team here: 
Our top priority should be investing in our workers by 1. ensuring they have the skills opportunities to get a good job, 2. making work pay, and 3. cutting the costs of raising a family. Read my thoughts on how we can all help our workers succeed: 
Let‚Äôs give patients full electronic medical records within 24 hours of request, a safe place to store them, and a trusted way to share them. Details matter when using patient data to save and improve lives. My @BidenCancer op-ed: 
North Dakotans have a strong, tough work ethic don't quit until they get the job done. VP @JoeBiden shares this same quality appreciation for hardworking men women‚Äîhonored to welcome him to Grand Forks for the @nddemnpl convention! #NDSen #HH4ND #HeckYeahHeidi 
Louise Slaughter was an unparalleled champion for women. I worked with her on the Violence Against Women Act, and I will always remember her grit and determination in standing up for women and families every day. She will be greatly missed. 
The people of Pennsylvania‚Äôs 18th district showed up yesterday. They demonstrated that they want to be represented by someone who stands up for working people with actions, not just words. Who has heart. They found that in @ConorLambPA. He will represent them well. 
I was in southwestern Pennsylvania with @ConorLambPA last week. Something's changing out there. You can feel the grassroots energy. And that'll beat big money every time. Let's bring this one home. Get out and vote, Pennsylvania. 
Everyone does better when women are able to rise as high as their talents will take them. On this International Women‚Äôs Day, we honor all the brave women who have spoken out this year, and we recognize that our fight is still far from finished. #IWD2018 
Sarah, I'm incredibly proud of you. You're a woman of real courage. 
It takes courage to speak out against sexual assault, or to step in to stop it from happening. If you know someone who has stepped up to the front lines of this fight, I want to hear about it. Nominate them today, because #ItsOnUs to change the culture: 
We need to give young immigrants who came to our country as children permanent assurance that they are safe here, and we need to give them this peace of mind now. They shouldn‚Äôt have to spend another day living with fear and uncertainty. 
When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, it included a provision that empowered women to take abusers to civil court. The Supreme Court wrongly struck it down. Now it is time for Congress to step up and fix this. 
Rev. Graham was spiritual advisor to a dozen Presidents - and countless millions of Americans. We remember his example of dignity and humility today, and Jill and I send our thoughts and condolences to the entire Graham family. 
I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence. 
We need to believe women like Colbie. We need to recognize the incredible courage it takes for women like her to come forward. And we need to change the culture so those who live in fear can safely get the support they deserve. 
We had the honor of having Jesmyn Ward moderate the 30th event on the #AmericanPromiseTour last night. It was wonderful to share the stage with such an incredible and acclaimed writer to discuss #PromiseMeDad. 
I‚Äôm in Indianapolis with @southcity22 and we have a message for thousands of fraternity brothers and sorority sisters here at #AFLVCentral and all across the country: #ItsOnUs to end sexual assault on college campuses. 
William Gay is the real deal - on and off the field. He‚Äôs using his voice to get other men involved to end sexual assault and domestic violence. He understands what this fight is all about. I‚Äôm glad to have you on the @BidenFoundation team @Southcity22. 
Incredible day opening the new @PennBiden Center in Washington. We're working on the foreign policy challenges of this new century and keeping America strong in the world. Looking forward to working with Dr. Gutmann and the @Penn community to engage a new generation of leaders. 
Video speaks for itself. Congrats, @Eagles! #SuperBowlLll 
This team never gave up. No matter the injuries, no matter the odds. They showed incredible heart. What a great win tonight, @Eagles. #FlyEaglesFly 
One year ago, our journey started. We‚Äôre thankful for this year of progress, collaboration, and purpose, and we‚Äôre eager to keep working. 
Proud to call you a friend, @RepJoeKennedy. You captured the idealism and optimism of our party ‚Äî and this nation. Because you understand that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity. And that in this country, no one gets left behind. Well done. 
This country has made great progress in changing the culture around advancing LGBTQ equality and ending violence against women. But there's plenty of work left to do. I'm pleased to have some of the best and brightest minds on these issues working with us. 
Dr. King said that change ‚Äúcomes through continuous struggle.‚Äù As we celebrate his legacy today, we‚Äôre once again living through a battle for the soul of this nation. We'll win this battle by following his example: standing up, getting involved, and demanding our voices be heard.

It‚Äôs not how a president should speak. It‚Äôs not how a president should behave. Most of all, it‚Äôs not what a president should believe. We‚Äôre better than this. 
3 years ago, @BarackObama I announced a plan for #FreeCommunityCollege. Today there are free tuition programs in 16 states over 200 communities. We won't stop working until every hardworking student in America has access to #FreeCommunityCollege. Join us @College_Promise. 
Boston has had many great mayors in its remarkable history, and @marty_walsh can proudly take his place among any of them. Thank you, Mayor, for giving me the honor of presiding over your swearing-in today. 
Jill and I, and the whole Biden family, want to wish you a happy, healthy, and safe holiday season. 
It‚Äôs been five years since 20 first-graders and 6 educators were murdered by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Their families continue to inspire me with their courage in turning tragedy into purpose. 
Ann Arbor - I‚Äôm terribly sorry I won‚Äôt get to see you this evening, but we want to make sure everyone can safely make it to #AmericanPromiseTour. Be safe in the snow. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing you on February 5th. 
Help your friends and loved ones get the peace of mind of health insurance for 2018. Remind them that this Friday is the deadline to sign up for health insurance through 
Doug Jones. Thank you, Alabama. You‚Äôve elected a man of incredible integrity, grit, and character. A fighter for working class and middle class Alabamians. He is going to make you proud in the Senate. 
Tomorrow, the people of Alabama will decide whether the United States Senate will gain the courage, character, and integrity of Doug Jones. Find your friends who can vote there, and make sure they're planning on doing it. 
The people of California are on my mind as they suffer through these devastating wildfires. Amidst the loss, I‚Äôm inspired by the bravery commitment of our firefighters. Day after day going back into the flames, risking their lives to save others. Incredible bravery. 
It‚Äôs a little too cold for ice cream in Madison, but I hope you liked the cupcakes all the same. Thanks for spending your birthday with me, @ElaineWelteroth - hope this next year is a great one. #AmericanPromiseTour 
Be who you are. Stand for what you are. Few people embody that better than @melindagates. Enjoyed discussing #PromiseMeDad, public service, and faith with such a remarkable woman in Seattle last weekend. #AmericanPromiseTour 
I'm going to keep speaking out on the importance of standing up to the Kremlin through my work @PennBiden. My colleague @mikercarpenter and I have written in @ForeignAffairs about the steps we need to take to defend our democracy. 
‚ÄúWe Are Living Through A Battle For The Soul Of This Nation‚Äù: An op-ed I wrote in the days following the violence and hateful events in Charlottesville, Virginia. @TheAtlantic #BidensBriefing 
I've been on the road talking about #PromiseMeDad, the book I wrote about my son Beau, but I've been most amazed listening to your stories. Incredible people overcoming loss, finding hope and purpose in their lives. Thank you for sharing. You inspire me. 
No one who has ever met Sandy Winnefeld has doubted his strength or resolve. And no one who reads this article will ever forget it. Sandy Mary - thank you for summoning the courage to turn your heartbreak into action to end this epidemic. 
One of the best shines I‚Äôve ever had. 
Throughout my career in public service, I‚Äôve heard a lot of great ideas, and developed a few of my own. Now we want to hear yours. Join us: 
Every week, we‚Äôll hear from leaders in business, politics, academics‚Äîand everyday Americans sharing bright ideas that keep us moving forward. 
Today I‚Äôm announcing the launch of the Biden Forum, a new space for conversations about America‚Äôs future: 
Today, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, let's remember all the work that remains and recommit ourselves to action: 
Thank you to the #AmericanPromiseTour moderators and thousands of readers who attended events or picked up a copy of #PromiseMeDad. Honored to be able to share the story of my son Beau, and what a remarkable man he was. 
May today serve as a reminder of our solemn duty to look after the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces and sacrificed so much for this country. #VeteransDay2017. 
To all our service men and women, veterans, and military families, thank you for your sacrifice. #VeteransDay2017 
You‚Äôre going to make us all proud, Danica. 
Juanita Perez Williams ran an incredible campaign in Syracuse. So proud of the work she did. And still hoping for a win for Manka Dhingra that will change the shape of Washington‚Äôs state Senate! 
And mayors like Rick Kriseman and Joyce Craig who are incredible leaders in their communities. 
State legislators like Sara Cambensy in Michigan and Danica Roem, Jennifer Carroll Foy, David Reid, John Bell, and Elizabeth Guzman in Virginia. People who stood up for working people of every stripe. 
Candidates like Ralph Northam and Justin Fairfax, who will ensure that Virginia‚Äôs economic recovery continues to reach every town and city in the commonwealth. 
A resounding defeat tonight for President Trump. Voters around the country rejected the ugly politics we have seen this past year. Instead, they chose candidates who unite and inspire us. 
Folks, there's an election happening tomorrow. We've got to keep our eye on the ball. Let's get this done. 
These tragedies aren‚Äôt inevitable. Don‚Äôt let hopelessness win today. We must persist in our efforts to prevent gun violence. 
Americans again murdered in a place of worship. Jill and I send our prayers to Sutherland Springs. 
Don‚Äôt let politics misinformation keep your loved ones from getting health insurance. Call/text them today to make sure they sign up! 
Today is the first day to sign up for 2018 health insurance through Deadline is December 15th! 
New York, we love you. Grateful to first responders who saved lives today. Jill and I are keeping you all in our prayers. 
Honored to work with a woman of great courage, my friend @ladygaga. With her leadership, and your help, we can change the culture. #ItsOnUs 
Alabama, this gets to the heart of why you should vote for Doug Jones on December 12th. A man of incredible integrity and intellect.

Looking forward to discussing my new book PROMISE ME, DAD with these inspiring individuals on #AmericanPromiseTour 
Looking forward to joining VP @JoeBiden for a discussion at @UDBidenInst about how we can bridge the divide facing our nation and work together to face our biggest challenges. Tune in at 1PM ET 
@JohnKasich @UDelaware @UDBidenInst There's a lot at stake, but John and I are still optimistic. I hope you'll tune in at 1:00PM - 
Looking forward to welcoming Gov @JohnKasich to @UDelaware @UDBidenInst to discuss bridging partisan divides restoring faith in government 
I'm grateful to @SenJohnMcCain for his lifetime of service to our country. Congratulations, John, on receiving this year's Liberty Medal. 
John McCain is the real deal. A model public servant. And my dear friend. I was honored to present him with the 2017 #LibertyMedal tonight. 
Unilaterally putting the Iran deal at risk does not isolate Iran. It isolates us: 
Proud to be at @RutgersU today with survivors activists working to change the campus culture on sexual assault. #ItsOnUs 
At 2pm ET, @JoeBiden will be live at @RutgersU to tell students #ItsOnUs to end sexual assault. Watch live at 
Inspired by teachers around the globe who help students like these in Zambia reach their dreams. #WorldTeachersDay

Jalal Talabani was a champion of the US-Iraq partnership and a friend, whose unifying leadership will be missed. 
Barack Michelle: all of the Bidens send our love today on your 25th anniversary. May you have many more years of joy still to come. 
On this heartbreaking day, our love to families who lost loved ones gratitude to first responders in #LasVegas. 
How long do we let gun violence tear families apart? Enough. Congress the WH should act now to save lives. There's no excuse for inaction. 
Appalled by the senseless loss of life in Las Vegas. Jill and I hold all those affected and grieving in our hearts. 
The Bidens caught up with @BarackObama and Prince Harry before cheering on Team USA today at @InvictusToronto. 
Now is not the time to go backward‚Äîit's on all of us to stop sexual violence. 
There is only one way to confront hatred and prejudice: head on. Well said, Lt. Gen Silveria. 
We Veeps stick together. Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Julia. 
Steve Scalise‚Äôs strength and resilience inspire all of us. Good to see you back on the job, Steve. 
Southern Florida chose a proven leader and consensus builder yesterday. Congratulations to @Annette_Taddeo, Florida‚Äôs newest State Senator. 
Beau fought to protect the most vulnerable among us. Thanks to my friend @barackobama for honoring his life‚Äôs work with the @BeauBidenFdn. 
Read about the devastating case that prompted Beau to train 5% of Delaware‚Äôs population in child abuse prevention: 
Today's Title IX decision is shameful, but the law is still the law. Colleges universities must honor obligations to students survivors.

#ItsOnUs is making great progress toward ending sexual assault, but today we face new challenges: 
Just had the chance to see President Trump's golf swing tweet. Enough. This has to stop. Our children are watching. 
Here's a path forward to choose a future that puts work first: 
My new initiative at the Biden Institute will identify strategies for building a future of quality jobs: 
America is strongest when we lead with our values‚Äîat home and abroad. 
23 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. VAWA is changing the culture saving lives, but our work continues. #VAWA23 
16 years ago today, terror tried to break us. It did not, and will never, succeed. Our grit determination are the strongest force I know. 
Jill and I are praying for the safety of everyone in the path of Hurricane Irma this weekend. Stay strong - the country stands with you. 
Any change that weakens Title IX protections will be devastating: 
Brought by parents, these children had no choice in coming here. Now they'll be sent to countries they've never known. Cruel. Not America. 
We are living through a battle for the soul of this nation. 
A first look at the cover for my new book, PROMISE ME, DAD 
Praying tonight for the victims of #Barcelona attack their families. Heinous acts of terror cannot break the spirit of our Spanish friends 
There is only one side. #charlottesville 
No. Not in America. We must be stronger, more determined and more united than ever. Racism and hate have no place here. #charlottesville 
Your service has been a great gift to the country, and your friendship and brotherhood are a great gift to me. Happy birthday, @BarackObama. 
Thrilled to see the 2028 Olympics coming to Los Angeles. Thanks to @MayorOfLA Garcetti who worked hard to secure a big win for US athletics. 
Hope to see you at a stop this fall on my #AmericanPromiseTour ‚Äì tickets are available now: 
Thank you to everyone who tirelessly worked to protect the health care of millions. You saved lives. 
To all of you working to stop Republicans‚Äô devastating ‚Äúhealth‚Äù bill: Thank you. We‚Äôre not done yet. Please keep going. 
Any final bill that looks anything like their proposals so far would be devastating. 
Every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve. Full stop. 
The GOP's "health" plan would gut care treatment for opioid addiction. Call your senators‚Äîthe time to act is now. 
Incredible progress in cancer research and treatment in just the last year offers new promise and new hope. You can win this fight, John. 
John and I have been friends for 40 years. He's gotten through so much difficulty with so much grace. He is strong - and he will beat this. 
@washingtonpost I was a senator for 36 years. I can assure you that your call matters. Your viewpoint might not always win, but your senators hear you. 
@washingtonpost Especially if you live in WV, NV, AK or OH now is the time to call your senators. Or, encourage your friends in these states to call. 
@washingtonpost If you believe health care is a right for all, make sure your senators know that this bill is a big step backward. 
@washingtonpost All Americans deserve the peace of mind that comes with knowing that you can get affordable care. But that‚Äôs now under threat. 
@washingtonpost By denying this right, Republican leadership‚Äôs ‚Äúhealth‚Äù bill is fundamentally flawed. It can‚Äôt even be fixed on the floor. 
@washingtonpost Republican leadership's ‚Äúhealth‚Äù bill would return us to a time when health care was a privilege for the wealthy, not a right for all. 
Today, I wrote in the @washingtonpost about the big problem with the Republican leadership‚Äôs "health" bill: 
Excited to share news about #AmericanPromiseTour - a series of conversations I‚Äôm hosting around the country 
Jill I send our condolences to the loved ones of service members lost in MS crash‚Äîthose who wear the uniform are the heart of our nation. 
Happy 4th of July! America continues the march toward tolerance, diversity and equality of opportunity that began in 1776‚Äîthat's patriotism. 
We‚Äôre live in a few minutes to talk about how @BidenCancer will bring renewed urgency to the fight against cancer: 
Jill and I are excited and ready to take the next step toward ending cancer. Are you with us? 
Let's see a bill that actually tries to improve folks' health care, and then we can have a reasonable debate about how to best do that. 
Especially now, when so many communities are struggling with opioid addiction, the bill's drastic cuts to Medicaid are cruel. 
Slashing Medicaid hurts kids, the elderly, people with disabilities and those struggling with addiction. All for tax breaks for the wealthy. 
The Senate health bill isn't about health care at all‚Äîit's a wealth transfer: slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy corporations. 
America‚Äôs soul is rooted in the promise of opportunity. We must protect, support welcome refugees to keep that promise. #WorldRefugeeDay 
Jill and I are praying for the people of Colombia and the families of the victims of tonight's bomb explosion. #BogotaEstoyContigo 
Congrats good luck to my former staffer Dr. Tony Allen, incoming Provost of @DelStateUniv! A great fit for a passionate public servant. 
Jill and I are praying for the victims and their families. Grateful for courage of my former colleagues, first responders Capitol Police. 
We meet unspeakable tragedy and hate with unbound resolve. I stand with the LGBTQ community, today and every day. #OrlandoUnitedDay. 
Honored to see Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in Athens ‚Äì his leadership on climate change and the environment is the example we need now 
Great to be with @PennBiden in Athens. A Europe whole, free, at peace remains vital to U.S. security‚Äìas it has been for the past 7 decades 
Congrats to Ambassador Andy Young, a dear friend and inspiration, on 85 years. Wish I could be in Atlanta tonight for AJY Leadership Awards. 
We're already feeling impacts of climate change. Exiting #ParisAgreement imperils US security and our ability to own the clean energy future 
It's time for big dreams and #AmericanPossibilities. If you're ready to elect folks who agree, say you're in: 
There‚Äôs no one better positioned on Earth to lead the world in the 21st century than America. We just have to believe it. 
America is at its best when we‚Äôre OPTIMISTIC and we THINK BIG. 
It‚Äôs time to remember who we are as Americans: Giving EVERYONE the opportunity to achieve the impossible. 
Our politics has become too small and petty. We‚Äôre better than this. 
America has always thought BIG. It‚Äôs stamped into our DNA. 
Climate change is an existential threat to our future‚Äîstaying in #ParisAgreement is the best way to protect our children global leadership 
To our nation's fallen troops: we thank you and will never forget. To their families: remember, you are never alone. 
Zbigniew Brzezinski's brilliant strategic mind enriched American foreign policy for decades--his distinctive voice will be greatly missed. 
Great to see Mayor @marty_walsh, and hear about everything he's doing to keep Boston strong. 
LGBT rights are human rights. Prejudice is prejudice; inhumanity is inhumanity. #IDAHOT #IDAHOT2017 
To the teacher who inspires me every day, and all the other amazing teachers changing lives, Happy #NationalTeachersDay! 
Millions of Americans will lose coverage. Up to the Senate now. Hoping for courage to return. 
Day of shame in Congress. Protections for pre-existing conditions, mental health, maternity care, addiction services -- all gone. 
Today @GeorgeMasonU, @JoeBiden called upon students, faculty campus leaders to work together to end sexual assault, because #ItsOnUs.

When faced with crimes of hate and inhumanity, every person of conscience must speak out in support of #LGBT rights 
Our mission is to influence, shape and work to solve tough problems facing the nation.

Being an American means being treated equally under the law, no matter who you are or who you love 
Today, I called on students across the country to speak out and step in to stop sexual assault. #ItsOnUs 
1 in 5 women and 1 in 16 men are sexually assaulted by the time they leave college. #ItsOnUs to stop it.

I‚Äôm proud to continue my work on national security issues through the new @PennBiden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. 
The correct word for sex without consent is rape. Period. #ItsOnUs to know the signs and to stop it. 
Every American who worries about getting health care when they get sick can breathe a sigh of relief today. 
Checks balances? Chair of cmte investigating WH can't share info w/ WH. McCain is right: Need select committee! 
Jill and I -- and the whole Biden family -- wish everyone a very safe and happy St. Patrick‚Äôs Day. 
Like many other Irish Americans, I‚Äôm proud of my Irish heritage and of my family‚Äôs contributions to our nation. 
Last year I had the privilege of walking down the streets my great-great grandfather once walked, in County Louth, Ireland. 
Today at #SxSW, we‚Äôre laying out how we‚Äôll harness the momentum of the past year to make real progress. 
This fight is personal for Jill and me. It‚Äôs personal for almost every American. 
Jill and I were honored to take the stage today at #SxSW. Join us in seizing the urgency of now to end cancer as we know it. 
Standing up for women is the cause of my life. We must change our culture to end violence against women #IWD2017 
Congratulations @TomPerez - You will help ensure our party continues to fight for economic fairness and for all to be treated with dignity. 
Incredible performance from my friend @LadyGaga. You amaze me ‚Äî and not just onstage. Proud to work with you to end sexual assault. #ItsOnUs

Today‚Äôs press conference in #Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory. My full statement on the #HelsinkiSummit: 
The #Ortega regime‚Äôs brutal crackdown on peaceful protestors in #Nicaragua is reprehensible. He must end the bloodshed and respect the democratic aspirations of the brave Nicaraguan people who yearn for freedom and peace. 
President Trump must be willing to confront #Putin from a position of strength demonstrate there will be a price to pay for his ongoing aggression. If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the #HelsinkiSummit should not move forward. 
Despite warnings from our top intelligence and military leaders, the Kremlin's efforts to weaken our institutions have continued with insufficient action by the admin or Congress to strengthen cyber defenses, safeguard election systems, and deter further destabilizing activities.

The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history. The Senate must do its job in scrutinizing the record involvement of Gina Haspel in this disgraceful program.

Respect for the God-given dignity of every human being, no matter their race, ethnicity or other circumstances of their birth, is the essence of American patriotism. To believe otherwise is to oppose the very idea of America. 
Thank you #Tempe the mayors who got Tempe Town Lake done. Look forward to accomplishing more along Rio Salado!

The #FY18NDAA is more vital than ever. As #Russia, #China #NorthKorea escalate threats, we must have a military that‚Äôs ready able.

The #FY18NDAA improves quality of life for service members their families, including a 2.1% pay raise for all troops 
.@BV is right - the best thing to do with the archaic protectionist #JonesAct is to scrap it. 
The threats to our security have never been more complex. We must have a ready capable military to rise to those challenges. #FY18NDAA 
For 55 consecutive years, the NDAA has been signed into law. In our partisan climate, the #FY18NDAA is a bill that can make both sides proud

The truth always prevails. Fake news driven by mischief and fake narratives driven by votebank politics stand shattered. 
Colours of Holi, flavours of music, a catchy tune and lots of Chowkidars...delight to watch! 
Happy Holi to the energetic Chowkidars in Banda. My best wishes to you all. 
Extremely adorable! Exuberant young Chowkidars these... 
Navroz Mubarak! Praying for a year filled with peace and prosperity. May everyone be happy and be blessed with good health. 
Thank you for the unwavering faith. 
Agenda 2019 ‚Äì Part-10 (Final) : Why Agriculture, Rural Development and Healthcare Require a GST Council Type Structure? 
Having a wonderful interaction with Chowkidars from across India. Join. 
Looking forward to interacting with over 25 lakh Chowkidars via audio bridge. The interaction begins at 4:30. Join the interaction on the NaMo App. 
The biggest casualty of dynastic politics are institutions. From the press to Parliament. From soldiers to free speech. From the Constitution to the courts. Nothing is spared. Sharing some thoughts. 
Rich in facts and high on detail, this sharp and insightful piece by @arunjaitley Ji presents an accurate picture of the transformation in the last five years. It also gives a befitting reply to the spreaders of fake news and narratives. Do read and share. 
Gallantry Awards and Distinguished Service Decorations were conferred upon outstanding people who have been serving India with utmost courage. Here are pictures from today‚Äôs ceremony. 
When the nation's Nari Shakti pledges support, rest assured India is in safe hands. Looking forward to seeing you all during the interaction with Chowkidars on the 31st of this month at 5 PM. 
This made my day! Humbled, and grateful to Sheila Ji.

Best wishes to Dr. Pramod Sawant and his team as they begin their journey towards fulfilling the dreams of the people of Goa. I am sure they will build on the work done in the last few years and boost Goa‚Äôs growth trajectory. 
Well done Hari! Thank you for sharing this. Wishing you a happy birthday as well! :) 
Happy to see young Chowkidar Navya take the lead and show remarkable passion towards India's development. 
Great! Best wishes to the youngsters. 
Saksham is full of vibrancy! Happy to see the energy. 
Guided by the Mantra of ‚ÄòReform to Transform‚Äô, the NDA Government has taken bold and futuristic decisions that have boosted the economy and rewarded the honest citizens of India. 
Paid tributes to my friend Shri Manohar Parrikar. He personified humility, simplicity and compassion. The good work he has done will be remembered for years to come. 
India will be eternally grateful to Shri Manohar Parrikar for his tenure as our Defence Minister. When he was RM, India witnessed a series of decisions that enhanced India‚Äôs security capacities, boosted indigenous defence production and bettered the lives of ex-servicemen. 
Shri Manohar Parrikar was the builder of modern Goa. Thanks to his affable personality and accessible nature, he remained the preferred leader of the state for years. His pro-people policies ensured Goa scales remarkable heights of progress. 
Shri Manohar Parrikar was an unparalleled leader. A true patriot and exceptional administrator, he was admired by all. His impeccable service to the nation will be remembered by generations. Deeply saddened by his demise. Condolences to his family and supporters. Om Shanti. 
Thank you! Eternally vigilant Yuva Shakti augurs well for India. 
My best wishes to these adorable young Chowkidars! Happy to see their Josh. 
Fantastic effort! With Chowkidars like you, dirt can never have a place in India. Keep up the good work. 
Mahamilawat or adulteration alliance has many Prime Ministerial candidates but they offer neither stability nor coherence in policy. The opportunism of the Mahamilawat will not fulfil the aspirations of the people of India. 
Issueless, aimless and visionless, the Opposition has no option left but to create and spread fake news. 130 crore Indians have seen through the lies of the Opposition and will never believe their fake narratives. 
Fellow Indians, Happy that #MainBhiChowkidar has ignited the Chowkidar within all of us. Great fervour! Ecstatic to see the passion and commitment to protect India from corrupt, criminal and anti-social elements. Let us keep working together for a developed India. 
As Chowkidars of our nation, we are committed to creating a clean economy by using cashless financial transactions. The menace of corruption and black money has adversely affected us for decades. Time to eliminate these for a better future. #MainBhiChowkidar #ChowkidarPhirSe 
Your Chowkidar is standing firm serving the nation. But, I am not alone. Everyone who is fighting corruption, dirt, social evils is a Chowkidar. Everyone working hard for the progress of India is a Chowkidar. Today, every Indian is saying-#MainBhiChowkidar 
This is a New India, where a person‚Äôs performance matters, not pedigree. No longer will dynastic politics act as a barrier to meritorious people joining the system working for society. Doors and opportunities are open for 130 crore Indians, not just a few powerful families. 
Public transport is convenient and comfortable. In the last five years, Metro projects in many cities have begun and work is underway in many more. This will further 'Ease of Living' for people. 
Happy to see this! 
Honoured that we have got the opportunity to work for Pune's development. We are committed to doing even more for the city and surrounding areas. 
Thanks for the faith in our work. 
Deeply anguished by the loss of lives due to the foot overbridge accident in Mumbai. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. Wishing that the injured recover at the earliest. The Maharashtra Government is providing all possible assistance to those affected. 
Joined the ceremony to mark the presentation of the Gallantry Awards and Distinguished Service Decorations. India is proud of all those who protect the nation. Their courage will be remembered for generations to come. 
India First, India always! 
Great gesture! Also, Kudos to the great Dabbawalas, whose notable work ensures lakhs of people are fed. 
Voting in high numbers is not about politics but about national interest, for which 130 crore Indians must work together. 
Good effort! Keep doing so till the elections. 
Happy to know that Jan Aushadhi stores are reducing medical expenses and providing good quality medicines. 
With the blessings of 130 crore Indians, what was deemed impossible for decades, by successive governments, is now possible. Our unwavering commitment to public welfare has ensured outstanding results for all sections of society. A lot has been done and we aim to do much more! 
No place for middlemen. No tolerance for corruption. No fake beneficiaries swindling away recourses. This is a New India. We have worked hard to remove corruption and punish the corrupt. Do read this fine piece by @arunjaitley Ji. 
My fellow Indians, Urging you all to strengthen voter awareness efforts across India. Let us all ensure maximum number of Indians come out to vote in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

India is proud of @Neeraj_chopra1, @DuttYogi and @WrestlerSushil. However, they made India win because they participated. I request Neeraj, Yogeshwar and Sushil to encourage people to participate in the elections and vote so that India wins here too! 
Dear @SriSri ji, @SadhguruJV ji, @yogrishiramdev ji and Sri M, Spiritual leaders like you inspire many through words and work. I request you to also inspire people towards greater democratic participation. Please encourage greater voter awareness.

Majestic Gir Lion....Lovely picture! 
Guided by ‚ÄòSabka Saath, Sabka Vikas‚Äô, NDA seeks your blessings again. We spent the last five years fulfilling basic necessities that were left unfulfilled for 70 long years. Now, time has come to build on that and create a strong, prosperous secure India. #PhirEkBaarModiSarkar 
India is proud that: 2.5 crore families have electricity for the first time. 7 crore households have smoke-free kitchens. 1.5 crore Indians got their own homes. These, and many other instances show that with the right approach and futuristic policies, nothing is impossible! 
Today: 50 crore Indians have access to good quality and free healthcare. 42 crore people of unorganised sector have access to old-age pension. 12 crore farmer households get yearly monetary support of Rs. 6000. Crores of middle class families are exempt from income tax. 
Today, the people of India know that it is possible to: Become the fastest growing economy. Give a befitting reply to terror. Eliminate poverty at a record pace. Make India Swachh. Remove corruption and punish the corrupt. Ensure inclusive and extensive development. 
The last five years have shown that with the blessings and participation of 130 crore Indians, what was earlier deemed impossible has now become possible. 2019 polls are about a spirit of confidence and positivity with which India is fulfilling the aspirations of its people. 
Wishing all political parties and candidates the very best for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. We may belong to different parties but our aim must be the same- the development of India and empowerment of every Indian! 
In 2014, the people comprehensively rejected the UPA. There was unprecedented anger over the UPA‚Äôs corruption, nepotism and policy paralysis. India‚Äôs self-confidence was at an all-time low and the people of India wanted to rid the nation of such decay and pessimism. 
Best wishes to the Election Commission, all those officials and security personnel who will be on the field, across the length and breadth of India assuring smooth elections. India is very proud of the EC for assiduously organising elections for several years. 
The festival of democracy, Elections are here. I urge my fellow Indians to enrich the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with their active participation. I hope this election witnesses a historic turnout. I particularly call upon first time voters to vote in record numbers. 
We are all proud of @CISFHQrs's service to the nation. They protect vital development infrastructure and thus, play a crucial role in India‚Äôs growth. Today, on the 50th Raising Day of CISF, joined their programme and interacted with CISF personnel.

We had a memorable programme at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg today. In the presence of young Divyang friends, a new series of visually impaired friendly coins were launched. These coins will help the visually impaired greatly. 
Janaushadhi Kendras across India are at the forefront of providing affordable medicines to the poor. This initiative has added significant strength to the efforts of the Central Government to ensure every Indian has access to healthcare that is of good quality and is affordable. 
Thanks to Janaushadhi Kendras, there is no need to go back from a medical store just because medicines are exorbitantly priced. Ours is a Government that cares and is ensuring affordable medicines for India's hardworking people. 
Healthcare costs in urban areas are rising considerably. In such times, Janaushadhi Kendras offer a ray of hope. Here is an interaction with people in Delhi. 
In addition to creating a healthier India, the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana has created economic opportunities for many. Dharmesh Bhai from Surat told me about his switch from a career in marketing to running a store under PMBJP. Have a look. 
The Rathore family from Rajasthan's Bikaner is more than satisfied with the quality of medicines thanks to Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana. I thank young Lokendra for his kind words too. 
India salutes all those greats who took part in the freedom struggle. 
A historic occasion for Maharashtra! Watch. 
Steps that will improve governance in the Northeast. Watch. 
At 1 PM this afternoon, I will interact with beneficiaries and entrepreneurs associated with the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana, from over 5000 locations. During the interaction, beneficiaries will share their own experiences. Do watch live! 
NDA‚Äôs priorities are India First. NDA‚Äôs policies put people first. Our decisiveness, work culture and track record are known to everyone. Opposition lacks proper leadership and a vision to take the country forward. 
The NDA is best suited to fulfil regional aspirations. Congress has always trampled over regional aspirations, pride and insulted any leader who does not bow to their High Command. 
Son of the soil, Bharat Ratna MGR lives on in the hearts of crores of people. Inaugurated a statue in his honour and also announced the decision to rename Chennai Central Station after him. NDA will always work hard to fulfil the dreams of MGR. 
I thank all those who joined the NDA rally in Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu. NDA in Tamil Nadu is a wide ranging coalition, which will always work for the people of the state. I urge my sisters and brothers of Tamil Nadu to bless NDA in the upcoming elections. 
India is home to the world‚Äôs largest healthcare programme, Ayushman Bharat. Today in Kalaburagi, I met beneficiaries of the flagship healthcare scheme and heard their experiences. 
The NDA Government at the Centre has come down heavily on corruption. Middlemen no longer get access to the corridors of power. That is why, those who thrived in the earlier times dislike me and are getting together to form a ‚ÄòMaha Milawat‚Äô or adulterated alliance. 
In Kalaburagi, highlighted steps taken by the Central Government for those associated with the sugarcane sector. 
These pictures from Kalaburagi show the strong support for @BJP4India. Karnataka is tired of the opportunistic alliance between Congress and JD(S). They promised to waive loans but ended up harassing farmers and filing cases against them. 
Vanakkam Kancheepuram. Happy to be here. Watch my speech at the NDA rally. 
Addressing a huge public meeting in Kalaburagi. Watch. 
The @PrayagrajKumbh set notable records. Emphasis on cleanliness sanitation was visible. A record was set for most number of people sweeping the floors. Records were also set in the fields of transportation and art. Use of technology for administering the Kumbh was commendable. 
Congratulations to the people of UP, especially Prayagraj, and the entire State Government under CM @myogiadityanath Ji for the exceptional organisation of @PrayagrajKumbh. This Kumbh showcased the best of our culture, spirituality and will be remembered for years to come. 
Kumbh 2019 now holds a Guinness World Record. By organising the historic parade of 510 Shuttle Buses in #Kumbh2019, Prayagraj Mela Authority achieved the record of largest parade of buses. 
Another record achieved by Kumbh 2019.The Guinness World Record for "Most contribution to a Handprint Painting in 8 hours", in which 7664 people participated, broke the former record held by Seoul of 4675 people. #Kumbh2019 
#Kumbh2019 has made a Hattrick under the Guinness World Records, a new record of "Most People Sweeping the Floor (Multiple Venues) has been achieved in Prayagraj, with the participation of more than 10,000 sanitation workers. 
Looking forward to being in Kancheepuram for the launch of many development works relating to road and railways sector. The Ennore LNG Terminal will be dedicated to the nation. A statue of the great MGR will be unveiled at Dr. MGR Janaki College of Arts Science for Women.

I will be in Kalaburagi today to launch key development projects. ESIC Hospital and Medical College, Bengaluru, and the Super Specialty Block of KIMS, Hubballi will be dedicated to the nation. There will also be an interaction with Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries. 
Last month, I had the honour of seeking the blessings of Boro Ma Binapani Thakur at Thakurnagar. I will always cherish the interaction I had with her. We stand in solidarity with the Matua community in this hour of sadness. 
Boro Ma Binapani Thakur was an icon of our times. A source of great strength and inspiration for several people, Boro Ma‚Äôs rich ideals will continue to influence generations. Her emphasis on social justice and harmony will never be forgotten. 
In Dhar, interacted with beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat. Glad that this initiative has transformed the lives of many by providing top quality and affordable healthcare. 
Sharing some pictures from the massive rally in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh. @BJP4MP

Remembering Biju Babu on his Jayanti. His noteworthy efforts for Odisha‚Äôs development continue to be cherished by generations. He undertook numerous measures for empowerment of the poor and marginalised during his long years in public service. 
On the auspicious occasion of Mahashivratri, prayed at the Dholeshwar Mahadev Temple in Gandhinagar. Har Har Mahadev! 
Here is how the dream of ‚ÄòOne Nation, One Card‚Äô was fulfilled today, furthering ‚ÄòEase of Living‚Äô for several citizens. 
It‚Äôs a memorable day in Ahmedabad‚Äôs history. Our beloved Ahmedabad gets a Metro! Inaugurated Phase-1, travelled on the metro and laid the foundation stone for Phase-2. We want to provide convenient, and cost effective transportation in our cities.

I look forward to visiting Gujarat tomorrow and the day after. I will be joining programmes in various parts of the state. In Jamnagar, I will dedicate to the nation the Annexe of the Guru Gobind Singh Hospital. Various works relating to the SAUNI Yojana will also be unveiled. 
The NDA Government is proud of our Defence Forces and will do everything possible to strengthen the forces. Those who ruled India for years neglected the forces when in power and now, when they are out of power these people are busy questioning our forces. Shame! 
The work done by the NDA Government for Amethi should have been done years ago. Sadly, it was not done. 
A boost to ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô and India-Russia friendship. The AK-203, that will be manufactured in Amethi will strengthen our armed forces and help them fight terrorists. 
Gratitude to the people of Amethi for blessing us today. Those in whom the people of Amethi placed their faith have ignored this great place for several years. In the 2019 elections, history will be created in Amethi! 
Great atmosphere at the NDA rally in Patna. I thank all those who joined the rally at the historic Gandhi Maidan. 
NDA Government is committed to Amethi‚Äôs progress. Addressing a public meeting in Amethi. Watch. 
Looking forward to being among my sisters and brothers of Amethi today. via NaMo App 
This afternoon, I would be joining the NDA rally at Patna‚Äôs iconic Gandhi Maidan. Watch my address at the rally live on the NaMo App. 
Their token approach versus our total approach...here is a glimpse of which approach has been more effective. 
Congress' approach of doles and deals harmed our Jawans and Kisans the most. Now, times have changed. Public welfare and poverty alleviation matter over everything else. 
This is a New India. We are fully capable of protecting our nation and giving a befitting reply to those who disturb the atmosphere of peace. 
Interacting with bright youngsters at the Grand Finale of Smart India Hackathon.

Here are some images from the Gita Aradhana Mahotsav at Delhi‚Äôs iconic ISKCON temple. Unveiled a Bhagwad Gita that is 2.8 meters high and weighs over 800 kg. The Gita‚Äôs prolific teachings have touched the lives of millions of people across the world. 
May the lamp of progress and prosperity shine brighter and brighter in every home. Join crores of beneficiaries of people-centric schemes of the NDA Government and hardworking @BJP4India Karyakartas in the ongoing #BJPKamalJyoti Sankalp Abhiyan. Come, let us spread brightness. 
The Gita teaches us harmony and brotherhood. Addressing a programme at Delhi‚Äôs ISKCON temple. 
Honouring those who have been conferred the Gandhi Peace Prize. Watch my remarks. 
Spoke on a widely discussed topic - jobs... 
I found it surprising that the Congress would oppose Aadhaar but the reasons are now clear. Know why... 
These two examples, one each from UP and Jharkhand, will show you how delayed projects adversely impact the development trajectory of our nation. 
NDA's priorities are people centric. Which is why, what must rise, like GDP growth Ease of Doing Business have risen in our tenure what should fall, like corruption prices are falling. In UPA, GDP growth rate was falling, business was tough, prices corruption were high! 
Speaking at the #News18RisingIndia Summit. Watch. 
Sharing some more glimpses from the Rashtriya Samar Smaarak, located in the heart of Delhi, near India Gate. Do visit the Smaarak whenever you can. 
Rashtriya Samar Smaarak, the #NationalWarMemorial has been dedicated to the nation. India is eternally grateful to all those who have served the nation with utmost bravery and vigour. It is due to them that our nation is safe, secure and can reach new heights of progress. 
People have seen the difference between a Government guided by India First and a Government guided by ‚ÄòFamily First.‚Äô Those who focused on ‚ÄòFamily First‚Äô were bothered about naming everything under the sun after one family. Our way is different, we care for 130 crore Indians! 
Those who ruled the nation for decades were not serious about the welfare of our armed forces. There are several examples to illustrate this point. From Bofors to Helicopter Scam, why is it that the same people‚Äôs names come up? 
Making India self-sufficient as far as defence production is concerned. 
With the blessings of the people of India, the four decade old demand for OROP was fulfilled during the tenure of the NDA government. Several ex-servicemen benefitted from this decision. 
Addressing ex-servicemen before the dedication of #NationalWarMemorial to the nation. 
In a short while from now, Rashtriya Samar Smaarak, the #NationalWarMemorial will be dedicated to the nation. Here are some glimpses of the Memorial, located near India Gate in Central Delhi. 
The people of Prayagraj must be congratulated for being exceptional hosts of the Kumbh in the city. The efforts of the Naviks, local administration, police personnel have been noteworthy. Congratulations to the UP Government for their stupendous organisation of the Kumbh! 
‚ÄòSwachh Kumbh, Swachh Aabhaar‚Äô was a great platform to honour those great women and men who have worked tirelessly to keep the Kumbh at Prayagraj clean. Here are some glimpses from the programme. @PrayagrajKumbh

The wait for our own National War Memorial is over! Tomorrow, India will get its own War Memorial, which will honour those who protect us with utmost valour. I am sure visiting the war memorial will be no less than a pilgrimage! #MannKiBaat 
The 44th Amendment made our democracy stronger and ensured authoritarian tendencies can't subvert our Constitution, like what was done during the Emergency. During #MannKiBaat today, we paid tributes to Morarjibhai Desai and his role in protecting our democratic fabric. 
India stands with our farmers! Launching the #PMKisan Yojana from Gorakhpur. Watch. 
Discussing several subjects during #MannKiBaat. Tune in.

Tributes to Jayalalithaa Ji on her birth anniversary. Her contribution towards the development of Tamil Nadu will be remembered for generations. A fine administrator and compassionate leader, her welfare measures benefitted countless poor people. 
Tomorrow‚Äôs launch of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi demonstrates two things: NDA's unwavering commitment to farmer welfare. Speedy decision making- a scheme announced on 1st February has become a reality in such a short span. This is the new work culture of New India! 
Tomorrow is a historic day! The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi will be launched from Gorakhpur. This is a scheme that will give wings to the aspirations of crores of hardworking farmers of India who feed our nation. 
A historic accomplishment by a stellar athlete! Congratulations to @apurvichandela for winning the Gold in the 10m Air Rifle event at the ISSF World Cup. Her success makes every Indian proud and motivates more youngsters to excel in various sports! 
Lok Sabha MP Shri S Rajendran will be remembered for his community service initiatives. He diligently worked for the development of Viluppuram and Tamil Nadu. Saddened by his demise. My thoughts are with his family and supporters in this hour of grief. 
India missed the bus when it came to the first three industrial revolutions but as far as the Fourth Industrial Revolution is concerned, this is a bus we haven't simply boarded, but we will also drive it! 
There are competitions now and there were competitions before 2014. Which ones do you prefer? 
Over the last 4.5 years, Hesitations made way for hope. Obstacles have been replaced by optimism. Issues have been sorted out by initiatives. The results of the efforts can be seen in many global rankings too.

India will always do everything possible to contribute to global peace and progress. 
The solution to hardships is in hard work. We are leaving no stone unturned to bring a transformative change in the lives of 130 crore Indians. 
I would be giving the prize money of the #SeoulPeacePrize to the Namami Gange fund. It is our collective duty to ensure a clean Ganga, which is so central to our culture.

The start-up sector has the energy of youngsters as well as the zeal to create something unique and beneficial for fellow citizens. Both India and the Republic of Korea are giving topmost importance to this sector. Hence, it is natural to deepen cooperation in start-ups. 
Over the last four and a half years, the transformative changes have led to: Sound economic fundamentals. Consistent growth. Pathbreaking reforms. Fruits of development reaching the poorest of the poor. Fast paced creation of futuristic infrastructure. 
For the last four and a half years, India has witnessed unprecedented transformation. I hope companies from the Republic of Korea leverage the series of opportunities India offers.

Held extensive talks with HRH Mohammed Bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. India‚Äôs ties with Saudi Arabia are historical and time-tested. Saudi Arabia is a valued strategic partner of India in the 21st century. 
During our talks, President @moonriver365 and I will take forward our conversations from last year on how best to advance the India-ROK partnership. I will also meet business leaders, the Indian community as well as eminent persons from all walks of life. 
As fellow democracies, India and ROK have shared values and a vision for world peace. As fellow market economies, our needs and strengths are complementary. ROK is an important partner for @makeinindia, @swachhbharat and @startupindia initiatives.

Inspired by the vision of Atal Ji and Balasaheb Thackeray Ji, BJP-Shiv Sena alliance will continue working for the well-being of Maharashtra and ensuring the state once again elects representatives who are development oriented, non corrupt and proud of India‚Äôs cultural ethos. 
Our association with the @ShivSena goes beyond politics. We are bound by a desire to see a strong and developed India. The decision to contest together strengthens the NDA significantly. I am sure our alliance is going to be Maharashtra‚Äôs first and only choice! 
Today, ten MoUs were signed between India and Argentina. Covering sectors such as defence, tourism, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, IT and civil nuclear cooperation, these agreements will further cement relations between our nations. @mauriciomacri 
During the talks today, President @mauriciomacri and I discussed ways to deepen trade ties. The coming of a large Argentinian business delegation to India augurs well for strong economic relations.

In Kurukshetra today, I had the opportunity to see glimpses of some of the toilets that have been painted. I was impressed, both by the dexterity of the artists and the passion towards cleanliness. Such awareness and efforts add valuable strength to the Swachh Bharat Mission. 
You‚Äôve heard of many competitions but we‚Äôve been having a unique one called the Swachh Sundar Shauchalaya, where toilets are to be painted. This fusion of art with cleanliness is commendable. In January, almost 1.3 crore toilets were painted. Well done to all those who took part! 
I am really happy to see @BJP4India leaders and Karyakartas strengthen the #MeraParivarBhajapaParivar movement across India. It is wonderful to see the BJP endearing itself to all sections of society and being at the forefront of raising issues of public welfare. 
On the way to Kurukshetra, captured a picture of the sacred Brahma Sarovar. Next time you are travelling to Haryana, do make it a point to see this iconic place and the other tourist places in the state. #IncredibleIndia 
A commitment towards the development of Haryana, including better healthcare and education opportunities. 
Increased maternity leave. Fulfilling entreprenurial dreams through Mudra Yojana. Focus on maternal health. The efforts of the NDA Government are contributing towards empowerment of women.

Deen Dayal Ji emphasised on honesty in public life. Today on his Punya Tithi, BJP is starting a movement #SamarpanDivas to further transparency and clean money in politics. Urging you all to donate to the Party. The NaMo App is an easy way to do so. I too made my contribution. 
Remembering Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Ji on his Punya Tithi. His emphasis on ‚ÄòIntegral Humanism‚Äô inspires millions of people. He was known as an exceptional organiser who mentored several patriotic and hardworking Karyakartas. His was a life devoted to nation building. 
I will be in Vrindavan today for a unique programme- to mark the serving of the 3rd billionth meal by the Akshaya Patra Foundation. Congratulations to all those associated with this mission. Their efforts towards eradicating hunger are exemplary. 
Today, will inaugurate @Petrotech2019 and address the inaugural session of the conference. #PETROTECH2019 brings together leading stakeholders of the oil and gas sectors. This conference will enhance investments in India in the oil and energy sectors. 
Thank you Hubballi for the enthusiasm today! @BJP4Karnataka 
Karnataka offers the best trailer of a 'Maha Milawat' government. Opportunist alliance. Decisions taken by a few. Constant bickering over portfolios. Internal fights. A helpless CM who becomes a punching bag for all coalition partners. Such a Government is disastrous. 
The people of India trust BJP. Our track record shows we can eliminate corruption and end the culture of middlemen roaming the corridors of power. 
The people of India trust BJP. Our track record shows we can eliminate corruption and end the culture of middlemen roaming the corridors of power. 
Good to see the vibrant conversations, insightful facts, stories and videos around how cities are transforming. Do check out #MODIfiedCities also share your observations. 
Overwhelmed by the strong support in Hubballi. Speaking at a rally. Watch. 
There‚Äôs no place for adulteration in a healthy society as ours. The people are going to reject the ‚ÄòMaha Milawat‚Äô taking shape among the Opposition parties. 
There is a 'family pack' for bail and no prizes to guess who are the beneficiaries of this pack. 
Never forget how arrogant Congress ministers insulted the middle class. In all their years in power they didn‚Äôt do anything for the middle class. In our 55 months, the NDA has focused on ‚ÄòEase of Living‚Äô for the middle class. 
Here a deal, there a deal, everywhere a deal...this is how Congress views defence sector. Always wanting to make money. For us, what matters is a strong India and the welfare of those who serve the nation. 
Wonderful to be in Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu. Watch my speech at the massive rally. 
The BJP has served, is serving and always will serve the people of Andhra Pradesh. In the last four and a half years, whatever had to be done to ensure justice for my sisters and brothers of Andhra Pradesh, we have done. We stand with Andra Pradesh and its great people. 
One must admire Chandrababu Naidu Garu‚Äôs honesty. He says he is a wealth creator! He‚Äôs obviously creating lots of wealth for him and his son while AP suffers. We are patriotic Indians...we are only thinking about the nation. Creating wealth is never on our minds. 
I thank the TDP cadre and their leader for wishing what every patriotic Indian also wishes- that Modi goes back to Delhi and once again becomes the Prime Minister! I guess they have read the writing on the wall! 
My ‚Äòsenior‚Äô in politics, Shri Chandrababu Naidu obviously has lots to hide. Else why won‚Äôt he give an account of what his miserable Government has done for Andhra Pradesh. Centre has left no stone unturned for the state‚Äôs progress but the priorities of the TDP are different. 
From fighting the Dushta Congress under the formidable NTR Garu to becoming a Dost of Congress, the TDP has come a long way. Andhra Pradesh has seen the TDP‚Äôs true colours. 
Chandrababu Naidu Garu keeps saying he is senior to Modi, he is senior to Modi. Of course he is... Know how! 
Speaking to my sisters and brothers of Andhra Pradesh. Watch the rally in Guntur. 
I would be visiting three states today. Shall be addressing rallies in Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), Tiruppur (Tamil Nadu) and Hubballi (Karnataka). You can watch the programmes on the NaMo App. 
The BJP Government in Tripura is focussing on the education sector. During the Communist misrule, Government jobs were given on the basis of party loyalty. Now there is a culture of merit and transparency. 
In less than a year, the BJP Government in Tripura has brought major changes in the state. There is pro-people governance and a hard crackdown on corruption. 
Honoured to have unveiled a statue of the great Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur at the airport in Agartala. 
The strong bond between Assam and the BJP can be seen at the rally at Amingaon today. The Centre and Assam Government are taking numerous steps for the progress of the state. The recent Budget of the Assam Government will have a transformative impact too. @BJP4Assam 
During Congress rule, the headlines from the Northeast indicated sheer neglect and apathy. The headlines now reflect positivity and development. Congress has zero respect for Assam‚Äôs culture. They had no will to implement important parts of the Assam Accord. 
Spoke to my sisters and brothers of Assam on aspects of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and also assured them that the interests of Assam and other parts of the Northeast will always be protected. 
The BJP is committed to preserving the culture and ethos of Assam. 
When it comes to Bharat Ratnas, those who ruled the nation for 55 years had a fixed approach- the award for some was reserved the moment they were born while others were ignored. Atal Ji‚Äôs Government and the present NDA Government honoured two greats from Assam. 
Hello Agartala! Delighted to address a massive programme in this city. 
One of the prime considerations behind the impetus towards Arunachal Pradesh‚Äôs all-round development is to make the state an even bigger hub for tourism. More people from India and across the world should come to Arunachal! Tourism also boosts the local economy. 
55 years of one party and 55 months of BJP... in all spheres of Arunachal Pradesh‚Äôs development, our work has been quicker and all-inclusive. The Congress ignored the youth of the state and their apathy towards the Jawans guarding our nation is anyway well known. 
Efforts are on, for not one, but two airports in Arunachal Pradesh! Such focus on connectivity and affordable aviation is unheard of in Arunachal Pradesh‚Äôs history! 
Arunachal Pradesh... A land associated with the rising Sun, brightness and a land that is home to courageous and warm-hearted people. Happy to have been in Itanagar. Several projects were initiated that will transform lives of the people of the state. 
I bow to Assam‚Äôs great culture. Addressing a rally in Amingaon. Watch. 
Boosting the development of Arunachal Pradesh. Watch the programme in Itanagar. 
Yesterday, had requested you all to share pictures of your visits to the Northeast on Instagram using #MagnificentNortheast. I shared some of the pictures in a Story on my page. Do have a look! 
Looking forward being among the sisters and brothers of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Tripura today. 
Pictures from the rally in Jalpaiguri. @BJP4Bengal 
In TMC rule the following are welcome: Illegal infiltrators. Chit fund looters. Leaders who face corruption charges. But, those believing in democracy are not welcome. What TMC is doing is not the culture of West Bengal. They are trying to destroy the state‚Äôs culture. 
Have you ever seen a sitting CM doing Dharnas to defend those who looted the people in Chit Funds? Well, it happened in West Bengal. It is deeply unfortunate. 
If we thought the Communists were bad, meet Communism Part 2- the TMC! Didi is CM but someone else‚Äôs Dadagiri goes on in West Bengal. Didi is in such a hurry to go to Delhi that she has left the state in the hands of middlemen and a syndicate. 
North Bengal and I, both have a deep association with tea. But, Didi dislikes both the tea sector and the tea-seller. No wonder she is not working for the development of North Bengal! 
Congress style of politics- every ten years promise a waiver that is poorly conceived and benefits only a handful of farmers. In Chhattisgarh Congress came to power promising waivers too but it‚Äôs been two months and the benefits have not reached the farmers. Shame. 
Pictures from the public meeting in Raigarh. People of Chhattisgarh are already disappointed with the Congress government in the state. I talked about the steps taken by the Centre for the welfare of the farmers, middle class and unorganised sector. @BJP4CGState 
Come to Jalpaiguri and see the support for BJP! Speaking at a huge rally. 
Speaking to my sisters and brothers of Chhattisgarh. Watch the rally in Raigarh. 
The beauty of the Northeast is spectacular. Do you have pictures of your own Northeast visits or glimpses of the spectacular natural beauty of the region? Share them on Instagram using #MagnificentNortheast. I will share some of the posts on my page too! 
In the afternoon, I will address a public meeting in Mainaguri. During my recent visits to West Bengal, I have been seeing the massive support for BJP. The people of West Bengal realise that only BJP can fulfil their dreams and aspirations. @BJP4Bengal 
Various development projects will be initiated in Jalpaiguri today. These will greatly benefit the people of West Bengal. 
The first programme will be a public meeting in Chhattisgarh‚Äôs Raigarh. I would be sharing my thoughts on a wide range of subjects during the programme. You can watch the speech on the NaMo App. @BJP4CGState 
Today and tomorrow, I will be joining programmes in Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura. Looking forward to interacting with the people of these states. 
History, Congress style: BC- Before Congress‚Ä¶the era where nothing happened. AD- After dynasty‚Ä¶the era where everything happened and that too thanks to one family. This is reflective of the arrogance that got them from 400 to 44! 
Congress imposed Emergency. Congress insults the Armed Forces. Congress goes on foreign soil and spreads lies about democratic processes. Congress misuses Article 356. Yet, they say Modi destroys institutions. How much do they lie? 
NDA‚Äôs efforts- strengthen national security. UPA‚Äôs efforts- weaken national security. On whose bidding are they opposing important defence deals? Why have they always looted the defence sector? 
More opportunities for education. Better healthcare. Controlling the menace of rising prices. Ours is a Government committed to ensuring a better quality of life for the middle class. 
Here are some important details about the opportunities being created for India's Yuva Shakti. 
Speaking in the Lok Sabha. Watch. 
Anguished by the passing away of Lok Sabha MP from Aska, Odisha, Shri Ladu Kishore Swain Ji. He will be remembered for his rich service to society. His work towards rural development was noteworthy. Spoke to his son Nachiketa and expressed condolences. 
NDA Government is honoured to have undertaken numerous steps for the wellbeing of the middle class. From a friendlier tax system to better healthcare, quality education to more opportunities, no stone is being left unturned to ensure ‚ÄòEase of Living.' #MiddleClassWithModi 
India is home to a dynamic middle class, which is making an outstanding contribution to the nation‚Äôs progress. The work ethic of the middle class is admirable and so is their honesty and compassion. 
Today, on #WorldCancerDay we reiterate our commitment towards ensuring early detection and affordable treatment of cancer. Initiatives like Ayushman Bharat have a strong emphasis on providing quality healthcare and ensuring cancer-free lives. 
Congratulated @DrKrishanMiddha Ji for the remarkable win in Jind. Over the years, the people of Haryana have been continuously supporting BJP‚Äôs agenda of pro-people, inclusive and corruption-free development. @BJP4Haryana 
I salute all those who are valiantly fighting cancer. Millions are inspired by their remarkable zeal. I also appreciate those researching on aspects of cancer treatment. Their efforts will go a long way in ensuring a healthier planet. #WorldCancerDay 
The iconic Dal Lake is mesmerising! Had the opportunity to visit the lake during my visit to Srinagar. 
Had the wonderful opportunity of interacting with Sarpanchs from across Jammu and Kashmir. I admire these remarkable men and women, who have shown great courage and are working to transform lives. 
The NDA Government has made sincere efforts to enhance the prosperity of farmers. All the Congress could do for years is to think about poorly conceived loan waivers! When the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi was announced, the Opposition was stunned. 
People from all walks of life came to bless the BJP during the rally in Jammu. Here are some glimpses. @BJP4JnK 
Youth of Jammu and Kashmir want peace and development. The ethos of this land is all about harmony and brotherhood. Any element who disturbs the developent journey of Jammu and Kashmir, spreads violence and hate will be given a strong answer! Terrorism will not be tolerated. 
The Central Government attaches immense priority towards energy, education, healthcare and infrastructure related works in Jammu and Kashmir. 
The last few months have witnessed an increase in the pace of development in Jammu and Kashmir. Projects that were pending for years are being completed and this is helping the people of the state. 
In Leh, talked at length about an important decision of the Government that will have a positive impact on the lives of the SC and ST communities. 
The beauty of Leh, Ladakh draws people from all over the world. Today, I had the opportunity to visit this vibrant part of India and interact with its wonderful people. The freezing temperature was inversely proportional to the people‚Äôs warmth! 
Interacting with students from across the country from Srinagar. Join us! 
BJP and Jammu have a strong bond. Addressing a rally. Watch. 
Every section of society has been empowered, every aspect of the nation has been strengthened by the Modi government over the past five years. Out of all the amazing work, what are the five things this government will be most remembered for? Let us know. #BharatKeMannKiBaat 
Participative democracy is an article of faith for our party. We have always worked to be an effective voice for rights and well-being of each and every Indian and to build a strong and prosperous India. #BharatKeMannKiBaat 
Your voice is of utmost importance. Urging you all to take part in 'Bharat ke Mann ki Baat, Modi ke Saath‚Äô, a unique effort by @BJP4India to get citizen feedback. What you all share will form the blueprint of our ‚ÄòSankalp Patra‚Äô for the 2019 elections. 
Delighted to be in Leh. Addressing a public meeting. 
Deeply anguished by the loss of lives due to the derailment of coaches of the Seemanchal Express. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. May the injured recover quickly. Railways, NDRF, and local authorities are providing all possible assistance in the wake of the accident. 
Even a large stadium was too small for the sisters and brothers who joined us in Durgapur. Thank you, your blessings are appreciated and give me strength in the fight against corrupt and criminal elements ruining West Bengal. 
My battle against corruption has ruffled many feathers, including TMC. So, they all assembled in Kolkata and collectively abused me. They got together to save their own families and hide their corruption. I will not rest till the corrupt are punished. 
In West Bengal: If one wants to study- Triple T. If one wants a job- Triple T. If one want to lead a life of peace and dignity- Triple T. TMC‚Äôs syndicates are looting and harassing the state. But, their days in power are numbered, I assure you. 
Her own party‚Äôs health is failing, support is dwindling so Didi decides to disassociate West Bengal from Ayushman Bharat! Why has compassion for the poor become a rarity in TMC? 
Ours is a Government that cares for each and every Indian. For decades, those associated with the unorganised sector were left to their own fate. Not any longer! 
Through poorly conceived loan waiver schemes, parties that ruled India for decades kept farmers under poverty. Most farmers never even benefitted from those so called waivers. NDA‚Äôs approach to prosperity of farmers is more inclusive, empowering and long term. 
The #BudgetForNewIndia, which was presented yesterday has a clearly defined approach to enhance ‚ÄòEase of Living‚Äô for the hardworking middle class. 
Eastern India is at the core of our development agenda but projects in West Bengal either do not start on time or their speed is slow. Do you know why? Because TMC refuses to work on any project where their syndicate cannot make money! 
The people of West Bengal are peace loving but the temperament of the Left and TMC is different. They thrive on violence and intimidation. I want to tell them- the people of the state will not be intimidated. And, the people will show their might by rejecting the TMC! 
I bow to the people of Thakurnagar. These pictures indicate the enthusiasm towards BJP. The people of West Bengal are speaking loud and clear- they want Parivartan, they want BJP. @BJP4Bengal 
West Bengal and BJP have a strong bond! Speaking in Durgapur. Watch. 
Amazing response at the rally in Thakurnagar. Watch. 
At a programme in Durgapur, the rail electrification of Andal-Sainthia-Pakur-Malda and Khana-Sainthia Sections, and the Hijli-Narayangarh third line will be dedicated to the nation. These works will strengthen the transport sector in the East and Northeast. 
Tomorrow, I look forward to being among my sisters and brothers of West Bengal. I will be addressing @BJP4Bengal rallies in Thakurnagar and Durgapur. 
This is a #BudgetForNewIndia and for all Indians. Watch my take. 
In his address to Parliament today, Rashtrapati Ji highlighted the transformative changes that have taken place and presented a coherent roadmap for the times to come. @rashtrapatibhvn 
I thank the people of Jind for blessing @BJP4Haryana. This is a seat where the Party has never won before. Glad to see the development agenda of BJP finding support among all sections of society. I congratulate the Haryana BJP and CM @mlkhattar for assiduously serving the people. 
Euphoric New India Youth Conclave in Surat. Watch the interaction. 
I will be interacting with youth and professionals in a town-hall programme at the New India Youth Conclave in Surat shortly. You can watch live on the NaMo App. 
Venus Hospital will cater to Surat‚Äôs healthcare needs. I congratulate all those who worked towards the establishment of such a fine hospital. Inaugurated the hospital today. 
The NDA Government has transformed the housing sector and the beneficiaries are the poor and middle class. Be it urban or rural housing, our track record is exemplary. The numbers are more, the houses are bigger and the era of middlemen is over! 
More airports, bigger airports, better connectivity, affordable prices‚Ä¶know how the NDA Government is transforming the aviation sector. A vibrant aviation sector augurs well for India‚Äôs development. 
Surat personifies hardwork and enterprise. It is also a city that has always respected Bapu‚Äôs ideals. The foundation stone laying and inauguration for many projects took place, including for a bigger airport. These projects will enhance ‚ÄòEase of Living.‚Äô 
Paid tributes to venerable Bapu at Rajghat. 
Inaugurating the state-of-the-art Venus Hospital in Surat. Watch. 
Surat Airport to be expanded, leading to enhanced connectivity and prosperity. Watch. 
Best wishes to my colleague Shri @PrakashJavdekar Ji on his birthday. Praying for his long and healthy life. 
We salute all the martyrs who laid down their lives for India. The country remains eternally grateful to them for their service and sacrifice.

Tomorrow, on Bapu‚Äôs Punya Tithi, I will be in Dandi, the place from where Bapu challenged the might of colonialism. In Dandi, the National Salt Satyagraha Memorial will be dedicated to the nation. This is a tribute to Satyagrahis led by Gandhi Ji, who worked for India‚Äôs freedom. 
Tomorrow evening in Surat, I will join the New India Youth Conclave. This is a wonderful forum, bringing together youngsters and people from all sections of society. I look forward to a wonderful interaction! 
In Surat, the Smt. Rasilaben Sevantilal Shah Venus Hospital will be inaugurated. This hospital will provide quality healthcare to citizens and strengthen the efforts to build a healthy India. 
I will be visiting Gujarat tomorrow to attend a wide range of programmes. In Surat, the foundation stone for extending the terminal building at Surat Airport will be laid. This will improve connectivity and economic growth in Surat and surrounding areas. 
Glimpses from ‚ÄòBeating the Retreat‚Äô ceremony. 
Depression and poor mental health are a cause of worry. However, aspects relating to these can get solved. Watch out for early signs, discuss, support and if necessary, do not hesitate to visit a counsellor. We will always support our young friends! 
Interesting questions by students from AMU and BHU on exams, subject choices and selecting careers. 
Youngsters asked me- should our goals be small or big. Here‚Äôs what we discussed. 
A common worry among parents- children spend too much time playing computer games... Young friends, enjoy the PlayStation but always remember the playground too! 
The report card of a child cannot become the visiting card of his or her parents. Every child is blessed with unique talents and deserves the right support to pursue them. 
I thank people from all walks of life, particularly student friends, parents and teachers for joining today‚Äôs Pariksha Pe Charcha 2.0 in large numbers. Here are some glimpses. 
Join the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2.0 Town Hall! Delighted to be among our Yuva Shakti. 
During his long years in public life, George Sahab never deviated from his political ideology. He resisted the Emergency tooth and nail. His simplicity and humility were noteworthy. My thoughts are with his family, friends and lakhs of people grieving. May his soul rest in peace. 
When we think of Mr. George Fernandes, we remember most notably the fiery trade union leader who fought for justice, the leader who could humble the mightiest of politicians at the hustings, a visionary Railway Minister and a great Defence Minister who made India safe and strong. 
George Sahab represented the best of India‚Äôs political leadership. Frank and fearless, forthright and farsighted, he made a valuable contribution to our country. He was among the most effective voices for the rights of the poor and marginalised. Saddened by his passing away. 
The @BJP4India is fully committed towards the development and prosperity of Assam. We will always protect the interests of the state. Several initiatives of the Central and Assam Government have contributed towards transforming lives of the citizens of Assam. @BJP4Assam 
Gratitude to my sisters and brothers of Assam for the strong support to @BJP4Assam in polls to three Tribal Autonomous Councils in the state. I appreciate the local unit of the Party for their constant efforts to serve the people of the state. 
During my visit to Madurai yesterday, I had the honour of meeting a remarkable woman entrepreneur, Arulmozhi Saravanan. The Mudra Yojana brought a qualitative change in her life and she even sold products to the PMO! 
Giri, your father is looking very good! 
Rajeev, I hope this brings more guests to the restaurant too! :) 
NDA Government is committed towards fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Tamil Nadu through a wide range of development projects. 
The people of Madurai welcomed me with great enthusiasm. It is my privilege that I have got the opportunity to work for the development of Tamil Nadu. 
We have heard of many types of contests but a contest to beautify toilets is remarkable and an innovative way to strengthen the Swachh Bharat Mission. 
Please convey my regards to Chandrakanth Ji. I am deeply touched by his gesture. 
Thank you! #MannKiBaat showcases the extraordinary aspects of India's past, present and future. I am merely a medium...it is the voice of 130 crore Indians. 
Seeing the brilliant youngsters of the NCC reaffirms my belief that India's future is bright thanks to our talented Yuva Shakti. 
Sharing some pictures from the NCC Rally in Delhi today. I congratulate all those associated with the NCC family and wish them the very best for their future endeavours. 
Thanks to the power of technology, Pariksha Pe Charcha Townhall Programme can be seen in several schools and colleges across India. This is an excellent opportunity to show solidarity with our hardworking and talented students who are preparing for exams. 
Dear students, parents and teachers, Tomorrow at 11 AM, we will be discussing stress free examinations during the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2.0 Townhall Programme. Looking forward to your presence! 
Happy to see this. These mementos I got during various programmes showcase the best of India‚Äôs diversity and artistic skills. For years, the mementos I receive have been auctioned. The proceeds of these mementoes will go towards Namami Gange. Know more. 
Saluting India's Yuva Shakti. Addressing the NCC rally. Watch. 
Glimpses from the public meeting at Thrissur. @BJP4Keralam 
Thank you for the phenomenal support Madurai! @BJP4TamilNadu 
To settle personal scores, leaders of the Kerala Congress played with India‚Äôs strategic interests. Can such a Party ever think about the welfare of 130 crore Indians? 
Elections will come and go, the nation will remain. 
The Opposition is bankrupt when it comes to a positive agenda for India‚Äôs development. Their respect for institutions is minimal. Congress leaders are also going abroad to insult people‚Äôs mandates. 130 crore Indians are seeing everything! They will punish such forces. 
Our endeavour is to make India a hub for the petrochemicals sector. ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô offers many opportunities in this regard. 
Today, various projects were initiated at the Kochi Refinery. These will go a long way in strengthening the petroleum and energy sector in India. 
Ensuring social justice and inclusive growth for all sections of society. 
As far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, the NDA Government is working to make the state a hub for defence and aerospace sectors. The State is also at the core of our vision of port-led development. 
Delighted to be in the ancient city of Madurai, which has a central place in the history and culture of Tamil Nadu. Laid the foundation stone for various projects relating to the health sector, including AIIMS. These projects will benefit the people of Tamil Nadu. 
Come to Thrissur and see the enthusiasm towards BJP! Addressing a massive rally. 
Tamil Nadu supports BJP! Watch the rally at Madurai. 
2019's first #MannKiBaat. Tune in. 
Best wishes to Meghalaya‚Äôs dynamic CM, Mr. @SangmaConrad on his birthday. He is energetically serving the people of the state. May Almighty bless him with a long and healthy life. 
Tune in at 11 AM today. #MannKiBaat 
Dear Exam Warriors, People across India are standing shoulder to shoulder with you as you prepare for the exams. Looking forward to seeing you all at a Pariksha Pe Charcha 2.0 Town Hall programme on the 29th! I hope you are sending your thoughts and ideas for the same as well. 
‡§õ‡•ã‡§ü‡§æ ‡§≠‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§¨‡§°‡§º‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§®! Thank you Chhota Bheem, for strengthening the team that is fulfilling the dream of a Swachh Bharat. This valuable support will surely motivate more youngsters to join the movement. 
I had a great interaction with @YourStoryCo on aspects relating to startups, innovation, entrepreneurship, MSME sector and more. Have a look. 
The colours of India‚Ä¶ Have a look at the cultural diversity of our country shown at the #RepublicDay2019 celebrations. 
India‚Äôs military and security prowess at Rajpath. Ours is a land of peace, which has shown the way when it comes to harmony and brotherhood. At the same time, we are fully prepared to give a strong answer to those elements who disturb the atmosphere of peace and spread violence. 
Our vibrant Republic! Here are some glimpses from the #RepublicDay2019 celebrations at Rajpath. 
At Amar Jawan Jyoti, a grateful nation pays homage to the brave soldiers who sacrificed their own lives for the nation. We salute their courage and patriotism. 
Congratulations to all those who have been conferred the Padma Awards. India is proud of each and every awardee, for the rich contributions towards various fields. They have made our nation and the world a better place! 
Pranab Da is an outstanding statesman of our times. He has served the nation selflessly and tirelessly for decades, leaving a strong imprint on the nation's growth trajectory. His wisdom and intellect have few parallels. Delighted that he has been conferred the Bharat Ratna. 
The songs and music of Shri Bhupen Hazarika are admired by people across generations. From them radiates the message of justice, harmony and brotherhood. He popularised India's musical traditions globally. Happy that the Bharat Ratna has been conferred on Bhupen Da. 
Nanaji Deshmukh's stellar contribution towards rural development showed the way for a new paradigm of empowering those living in our villages. He personifies humility, compassion and service to the downtrodden. He is a Bharat Ratna in the truest sense! 
Heard the insightful views of President @CyrilRamaphosa at the Gandhi-Mandela Memorial Freedom Lecture in New Delhi. 
Cooperation in areas such as agriculture, food processing, skill development, IT, gems and jewellery augurs well for the partnership between India and South Africa. President @CyrilRamaphosa and I also talked about steps to boost people-to-people ties. 
India and South Africa are shaped by the ideals of the great Mahatma Gandhi and the venerable Madiba. Guided by their thoughts, we are committed towards ensuring peace and prosperity for the people of our nations as well as deepening cooperation in various sectors. 
India is honoured to welcome President @CyrilRamaphosa. He is visiting us at a special time, when we are marking Bapu's 150th birth anniversary and have marked the birth centenary of beloved Madiba. This visit will have a positive impact on India-South Africa relations. 
Addressing the India-South Africa Business Forum. Watch. 
Best wishes to the people of Himachal Pradesh on their Statehood Day. May this state, the land of natural beauty and bravery, attain even more prosperity in the years to come. I pray that the people of this state are blessed with joy and good health. 
I urge people from all walks of life to create awareness on voter registration and especially request my young friends to register themselves as voters if they have not done so already. Every vote cast enhances our democratic fabric. 
Greetings on #NationalVotersDay. This is a day to reaffirm our commitment towards further strengthening our democracy by unfailingly participating in democratic processes at the local, state and national levels. Your doing so will go a long way in building a New India. 
With this launch, India also becomes the first country to use the fourth stage of a space rocket as an orbital platform for micro-gravity experiments. @isro 
Heartiest congratulations to our space scientists for yet another successful launch of PSLV. This launch has put in orbit Kalamsat, built by India's talented students. 
Under the leadership of Shri @myogiadityanath Ji and his team, Uttar Pradesh has been achieving remarkable success in several sectors. The Centre and UP Government will continue to do everything possible so that the youth of UP can fulfil their aspirations. 
On the special occasion of Uttar Pradesh Diwas I convey my greetings to the people of UP and pray for the continued progress of the state. This is a state whose contribution to India‚Äôs history is remarkable. People from UP have excelled in all spheres. 
Had an excellent interaction with tableaux artistes, guests from tribal communities, NCC cadets and NSS volunteers at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg today. 
India is phenomenally proud of these young achievers, who have been distinguishing themselves in a wide range of areas. Wishing them the very best for their endeavours ahead.

Kartik Kumar Goyal and Adrika Goyal from Madhya Pradesh showed courage and social consciousness in providing food, water, and first aid to panicked train passengers during an adverse situation. I congratulate my brave young friends on winning the Bal Shakti Puraskar!

Anish, from Haryana, is great at aiming and achieving. He is an international Gold medalist young shooter who won at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. I congratulate young Anish on winning the Bal Shakti Puraskar and wish him great success in the future! 
It was a pleasure meeting young Priyam Tated. From Andhra Pradesh, he is a wonderful exponent of Roller or Figure Skating. He has made India proud by winning several awards on the world stage. Congratulations Priyam on winning the Bal Shakti Puraskar. 
My young friend Esow from Andaman and Nicobar islands has made us proud. He was awarded the Junior World No. 1 at the UCI Junior Track Cycling World Championship in Switzerland. Congratulations, Esow!

Had a wonderful interaction with winners of Rashtriya Bal Puraskar 2019. 
Having a great interaction with Karyakartas from Maharashtra. Watch. 
I am grateful to the Bose family for presenting me a cap worn by Netaji Bose himself. The cap has been immediately added to the display gallery at Kranti Mandir in the Red Fort complex. I hope more youngsters come to Kranti Mandir and get inspired by the life of Netaji Bose. 
To see Gurudev Tagore‚Äôs works at Drishyakala is a treat for art lovers. We all know Gurudev Tagore as a prolific writer but he also had a strong link with the world of art. He produced lots of works, featuring multiple themes. Gurudev‚Äôs works were also exhibited internationally. 
Works of eminent Indian artists like Raja Ravi Varma, Gurudev Tagore, Amrita Sher-Gil, Abanindranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Gaganendranath Tagore, Sailoz Mookherjea amd Jamini Roy are on display at the exhibition. 
I would specially urge art lovers to visit Drishyakala, which will take you through the finest aspects of Indian art and culture. There are 4 historical exhibitions, spanning three centuries, with over 450 works of art! 
Museums on Netaji Bose and Azad Hind Fauj are a key part of Kranti Mandir. History echoes from these walls. In this very building, brave sons of India, Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shah Nawaz Khan were put on trial by the colonial rulers. 
This complex includes Museums on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, Yaad-e-Jallian Museum (on Jallianwala Bagh and World War 1), Museum on 1857- India‚Äôs First War of Independence and Drishyakala- Museum on Indian Art. 
It was extremely humbling to inaugurate four museums relating to India's rich history and culture. This entire complex of museums will be known as Kranti Mandir as a tribute to the revolutionary zeal and courage of our great freedom fighters. 
These museums being inaugurated today will deepen the connect between our glorious history and our youth as well as add to the patriotic fervour among citizens. 
I will also inaugurate the Yaad-e-Jallian Museum (on Jallianwala Bagh and World War 1), Museum on 1857- India‚Äôs First War of Independence and Drishyakala- Museum on Indian Art at the Red Fort. 
In a short while from now, I will be inaugurating Museums on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army at the iconic Red Fort in Delhi. 
Remembering the courageous Balasaheb Thackeray on his Jayanti. Respected Balasaheb was unwavering in his commitment towards protecting the rights and wellbeing of people. He was bold and was blessed with a sharp intellect and wit. His oratory skills mesmerised lakhs of people. 
I bow to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his Jayanti. He was a stalwart who committed himself towards ensuring India is free and leads a life of dignity. We are committed to fulfilling his ideals and creating a strong India. 
My first brush with a big city, organisational duties in the RSS and a yearly 5-day journey to a remote forest during Diwali‚Ä¶ Part 3 of the interaction with @HumansOfBombay takes you through experiences from my youth a request for today‚Äôs youngsters. 
Celebrate, do not fear exams. I am glad that people not only from India but also from overseas are going to be a part of the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2.0 programme. Keep sharing your exam experiences on MyGov so that others read and get inspired. 
Inaugurated Centers of Excellence at Deen Dayal Hastkala Sankul. These centres will give a boost to those associated with the textiles and handicrafts sector and contribute to India‚Äôs prosperity. 
Made an announcement at the #PBD2019. Know what it is... 
At the peak of his party‚Äôs power, a former PM said that for every Rupee, only 15 paisa reaches the poor. Which was the hand that was siphoning off all funds? NDA Government‚Äôs paradigm shift in Governance has ensured the fruits of development reach the intended beneficiaries. 
India is at the forefront of global leadership in various sectors. Our country is undertaking numerous initiatives to ensure a better tomorrow for the coming generations. 
Looking forward to being in beloved Kashi today for the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. This is an excellent forum to engage with the Indian diaspora, which is distinguishing itself all over the world. #PBD2019 @PBDConvention 
I have had the privilege to visit the Sree Siddaganga Mutt and receive the blessings of His Holiness Dr. Sree Sree Sree Sivakumara Swamigalu. The wide range of community service initiatives being done there are outstanding and are at an unimaginably large scale. 
HH Dr. Sree Sree Sree Sivakumara Swamigalu remained at the forefront of ensuring better healthcare and education facilities for the marginalised. He represents the best of our traditions of compassionate service, spirituality and protecting the rights of the underprivileged. 
His Holiness Dr. Sree Sree Sree Sivakumara Swamigalu lived for the people, especially the poor and vulnerable. He devoted himself towards alleviating ills like poverty, hunger and social injustice. Prayers and solidarity with his countless devotees spread all across the world. 
Statehood Day greetings to the people of Tripura. In less than a year, the state has made remarkable progress. It is realising it‚Äôs true potential and people‚Äôs aspirations are being fulfilled at a record pace. May this spirit grow further in the coming years. 
Manipur is blessed with immense natural beauty and hardworking citizens. I can never forget the affection I have got in the state. On their Statehood Day, I greet my sisters and brothers of Manipur. May the state continue scaling new heights of development. 
On the special occasion of their Statehood Day, greetings to the people of Meghalaya. People from Meghalaya have made a notable contribution to our country. I pray for the state‚Äôs continuous progress. 
Not losers but Rockstars! No selfie Jab We Met but there will always be another occasion. :) 
Happy to know! My best wishes. 
Thank you Divya Ji. 
The entire nation admires Jeetendra Ji for his acting. And, as I said yesterday, he is full of energy! 
As far as the issue of mining in Goa is concerned, the Centre, State Government and BJP MPs from the state are looking at all possible ways to solve the matter. BJP will always safeguard the rights and wellbeing of the poor. 
The NDA government in unwavering in our commitment to social justice. Those who ruled the nation for years had no vision or roadmap to ensure empowerment for all. 
NDA governments at the Centre and Maharashtra have undertaken record number of initiatives for the farmers. On the contrary, Congress and NCP‚Äôs notable contribution was irrigation scam and total apathy towards farmers. 
This question by a @BJP4Maharashtra Karyakarta reminded me of the days when I worked in the party organisation. I also spoke about why BJP is different from other parties. 
Interacting with BJP Karyakartas from Maharashtra and Goa. Watch. 
Asha Ji, thank you for gracing the programme with your presence. The entire nation looks up to you for your stupendous contribution to the film world. @ashabhosle 
Yes, I agree with you. @itsBhushanKumar 
Looking happy as always, Manoj Bhai! 
In addition to preservation, I hope this museum emerges as a centre of inspiration, where people get to see the more minute aspects of acting, production, film making and more. It will further endear the film world to the people. 
I enjoyed interacting with you and other members of the film fraternity. This community has been at the forefront of showcasing India's culture internationally. @kunalkohli 
When @KapilSharmaK9 appreciates somebody's humour, it sure makes that person happy and I am no exception. :) Thank you for the kind words Kapil. 
Happy to have met you, @arrahman. 
We have several talented youngsters and we also have so many talented film personalities who can mentor these youth. Channelising this talent through such universities can be extremely beneficial. 
The wonderful city of Mumbai is now home to the excellent National Museum of Indian Cinema. Here are some pictures. 
They got together in Kolkata with no agenda but to stop BJP. They talk of democracy in a state where the ruling party does not even allow local elections democratically. 130 crore Indians are watching their games with great amusement. India will give them a befitting reply! 
Their day begins with Modi, ends with Modi. All they want to do is further their own dynasties. They have zero vision for India. Our approach is different. For us, India is everything, 130 crore Indians are everything. 
Entire Opposition hates me because my ‚Äòcrimes‚Äô are: Waging the toughest war against corruption. Stopping the reign of middlemen from the corridors of power. Giving the poor what belongs to them in the first place but was denied for years. 
The progress made by the Union Territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, as well as Daman and Diu in the last four years will make you very happy! 
Our only aim is development. We want to work for 130 crore Indians. Speaking in Silvassa. Watch. 
Had the privilege of inaugurating the Larsen and Toubro Armoured Systems Complex in Hazira, Gujarat. Boosting ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô in the defence sector is our endeavour. I am glad that the private sector too is supporting this pursuit and making a valuable contribution. 
I congratulate the entire team of Larsen Toubro for building the state-of-the-art K-9 Vajra Self Propelled Howitzer. This is a significant contribution towards India‚Äôs defence sector and protecting the country. 
Checking out the tanks at L&amp;T‚Äôs Armoured Systems Complex in Hazira. 
The first #MannKiBaat of 2019 will take place on the 27th of this month. Share your ideas and suggestions for it. Dial 1800-11-7800 and record your message. You can also share inputs on the MyGov Open Forum or the NaMo App. 
Tomorrow evening, I will be in Mumbai to inaugurate the National Museum of Indian Cinema. This museum will showcase the rich history of Indian cinema and highlight the contribution of cinema in our country's progress. 
The laser show at Dandi Kutir is wonderful! Technology has merged with history and the show takes the viewers through the life of the great Bapu. Happy to have inaugurated the show today. 
The m-Arogya App will be launched tomorrow along with door to door waste collection, segregation and processing of solid waste facilities in Dadra and Nagar Haveli. I would also be addressing a public meeting at Silvassa. 
An IT policy for Dadra and Nagar Haveli will be released tomorrow. I congratulate the local administration for emphasising on the power of technology. Through technology, effective service delivery is possible and transparency is furthered. 
Several development projects for Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli will be launched tomorrow. PM Jan Arogya Yojana certificates and Forest Rights certificates will be distributed to beneficiaries as well. Glad that the Centre's schemes are touching the lives of the poor. 
I am happy to be visiting the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli tomorrow. The foundation stone for a medical college in Sayli will be laid. This institution is going to open many opportunities in the healthcare sector. Youngsters from nearby areas will benefit greatly. 
I shall be visiting Hazira tomorrow. I would be dedicating L&amp;T‚Äôs Armoured Systems Complex to the nation and also be laying the foundation stone for the Nirali Cancer hospital at Navsari. 
Mr. Andrej Babi≈°, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic and I held wide-ranging talks in Gandhinagar. His presence at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit is a great gesture. We discussed bilateral cooperation in defence, transportation and manufacturing. 
Had an excellent meeting with PM @larsloekke of Denmark. Denmark is a valued friend and we discussed deepening cooperation in energy, trade, agriculture and other areas. 
The champion of chess! Young D Gukesh has made the country proud by his accomplishment. His diligence and perseverance are noteworthy! Congratulations to him and best wishes for his future endeavours. 
Here is a unique contest that strengthens the Swachh Bharat Mission! In two weeks ten lakh rural toilets have already been painted. Share your Swachh Sundar Shauchalaya using #MyIzzatGhar. 
The Government of India is making every effort to ensure the fruits of development reach every citizen with ease and efficiency. 
New infrastructure for New India. Transformative measures that are leading to transformative outcomes. 
Doing business in India is easier, cheaper, faster and smarter. 
Those who have been visiting India in the last four years have seen first hand the series of transformations taking place. We are reducing government and enhancing governance. 
The Vibrant Gujarat Summit has: Dignity of the presence of top political leaders. Energy of CEOs and corporate leaders. Gravitas of institutions and opinion makers. Vitality of young enterprises and start-ups. 
India is honoured to host the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Mr. Shavkat Mirziyoyev. We had fruitful talks on the sidelines of the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in Gandhinagar. We discussed various aspects relating to India-Uzbekistan ties. @president_uz 
Great meeting with PM @JosephMuscat_JM of Malta. Our talks will add tremendous strength to bilateral ties between our nations and benefit the people of our countries. 
Vibrant Gujarat has emerged as a global forum. Addressing the Summit now. Watch. 
His Holiness Dr. Sree Sree Sree Sivakumara Swamigalu is a remarkable personality and has positively impacted crores of lives through his outstanding service. The entire nation is praying for his speedy recovery and good health. 
At the Ahmedabad Shopping Festival I too could not resist from shopping! Purchased some Khadi products using the RuPay card. I urge you all- keep buying Khadi and contribute to the empowerment of lakhs of weavers associated with the industry. It is also a great tribute to Bapu! 
At the inauguration of the Ahmedabad Shopping Festival, I talked at length about the numerous steps taken by the Central Government for the MSME sector. Our small entrepreneurs are exceptionally talented and we are committed to ensuring the right platform for them to prosper. 
Today is a big day for Ahmedabad! The city is hosting a first of its kind shopping festival. This festival is a great opportunity for entrepreneurs and consumers. It has a wide range of products, a good mix of the traditional and the modern. 
For a long time, access to proper healthcare was considered out of reach for the poor. Ayushman Bharat changed that. Ours is a Government that cares for the downtrodden and we want to ensure that they lead healthy lives. 
The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Medical Sciences and Research is an excellent public hospital, which will strengthen the efforts to provide quality healthcare to the poor. Am glad to have inaugurated the hospital and seen parts of it. 
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai was an outstanding scientist, whose contribution to the nation has been extremely rich. Today in Ahmedabad, a statue of Dr. Sarabhai was inaugurated in the presence of his family. 
Thank you Mr. Bill Gates for your appreciation. Ayushman Bharat stems out of our commitment to provide top quality and affordable healthcare to the poor. The first 100 days have been remarkable! Large number of people benefited and lot more will in the coming days. @BillGates 
The Ahmedabad Shopping Festival is amazing! Come visit. 
Inaugurating the Sardar Patel hospital in Ahmedabad. Watch my speech. 
I commend the energetic @BJYM team for their #VijayLaksh2019 movement that will mobilise Yuva Shakti from all over India on a large scale for a strong mandate for the BJP. Our Party is fully committed to fulfilling the dreams and aspirations of our talented youngsters. #NaMoYuva 
Individuals like Mr. Yohei Sasakawa motivate millions of people. He is at the forefront of many philanthropic initiatives. His compassionate nature can be seen in the manner in which he‚Äôs worked to eliminate leprosy. Congratulations to him for the Gandhi Peace Prize, 2018. 
Education is a strong means to empowerment and Ekal Abhiyan Trust is working in remote areas, so that children from tribal families get the opportunity to study. Their role in furthering women empowerment is laudatory. Congratulations to them for the Gandhi Peace Prize, 2017. 
The Sulabh International family has added immense strength to the Swachh Bharat movement. This is a team that is working constantly at the grassroots level to realise Bapu‚Äôs dream of a clean India. I congratulate Sulabh International for the Gandhi Peace Prize, 2016. 
The Akshaya Patra Foundation‚Äôs determined efforts ensure nutritious meals for many. Their outstanding work has also ensured more children go to school. I congratulate them for the Gandhi Peace Prize, 2016. @AkshayaPatra 
The Vivekananda Kendra is doing commendable work towards the development of our villages. Their initiatives to improve education and community service have touched several lives, particularly youngsters. I congratulate @vkendra for the Gandhi Peace Prize, 2015. 
The Ahmedabad Shopping Festival will also be inaugurated tomorrow. The Festival offers an exceptional opportunity for local entrepreneurs to showcase their products. 
Tomorrow in Ahmedabad, I will inaugurate the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Medical Sciences and Research. This is state-of-the-art public hospital will provide top quality healthcare to the people of Gujarat. 
Over the next two days, I would be attending various programmes in Gujarat, including the Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2019. Since its inception in 2003, the Summit has played a key role in bringing more investment to Gujarat and enhancing the state‚Äôs progress. 
Adorable picture! Such support is my biggest source of strength. 
Happy to know. There is always so much to learn from Karyakartas and volunteers. Their strong support is cherished by our Party. 
It is a wonderful family! :) 
These interactions via the NM Mobile App are healthy and extensive discussions between the family of BJP Karyakartas. There is no formality. BJP is proud of each and every Karyakarta, who makes the party strong. 
India's progress is not complete till the eastern part of our nation grows. It is a privilege to work for the people of the region. Tremendous work is underway in all sectors that will further 'Ease of Living.' 
Political stability, Decisive Leadership and a Clear Mandate ‚Äì Their Relationship with Growth 
Prayed for the development of India and the peace and happiness of 130 crore Indians at the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. 
To the UDF and LDF I say: Do not under estimate the BJP Karyakarta. Your taunts your violence cannot break the morale of the BJP Karyakarta. You should see what happened in Tripura. What happened in Tripura, will happen in Kerala! 
The UDF and the LDF are two sides of the same old coin. 
If there is one party that has been at the forefront of standing with Kerala and its culture, it is the BJP. For us, the people of Kerala and their aspirations are not a matter of convenience but of conviction. 
Today, India is growing rapidly. This is powered by the hard-work talent of the people of our nation. From economy to ease of doing business from start-ups to satellites, we are achieving great progress in each sector. 
The tribal communities of Odisha are the pride of the state. We can learn lots from their culture and traditions. The NDA Government has taken numerous steps to improve education and sporting facilities, which will directly benefit tribal communities. 
We are happy that due to the efforts of the Centre, rail and air connectivity has improved across Odisha. With better connectivity, comes more opportunity and faster development. 
Making every effort for Odisha‚Äôs progress. Inaugurated/laid the foundations for projects worth over Rs. 1500 crore. These projects will have a transformative impact on Odisha‚Äôs progress. They will also draw more tourists, who can see the exceptional Odia culture. 
Thank you Kollam for the warm welcome and support. Addressing a rally. Watch. 
Addressing a programme to mark the inauguration of Kollam bypass. 
Pariksha Pe Charcha 2.0 will be an interesting conversation with students, parents and teachers on exams, life and more. Participate in this unique contest and get a chance to be there at the event in Delhi! 
Best wishes to all those taking part in #GAvS2019! May the Summit witness extensive and insightful discussions relating to the aviation sector. Our Government is actively working on enhancing aviation infrastructure, improving connectivity and making flying more affordable. 
Euphoric atmosphere at the rally in Balangir. Watch. 
Furthering ‚ÄòEase of Living‚Äô for Odisha‚Äôs citizens. Inaugurating development works in Balangir. 
In Thiruvananthapuram I would visit the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. A series of welfare measures for pilgrims would be inaugurated as well. 
I look forward to visiting Kerala tomorrow. I would be in Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram for various programmes. The Kollam bypass on NH-66 would be inaugurated. This project improve the traffic situation and enhance connectivity. 
More development works that will be inaugurated are: Bridge no. 588 between Therubali-Singapur road station. Passport Sewa Kendras at Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Puri, Kandhamal, Bargarh and Balangir. Renovation and restoration works at Asurgarh Fort in Kalahandi.

Happy #Uttarayan. May you all scale new heights of progress in the times to come. 
Greetings on the special occasion of Magh Bihu. 
Best wishes on Pongal! 
#HappyMakarSankranti to everyone! 
I have often been a part of the anniversary celebrations of Thuglak but unfortunately, this time I have not been able to. However, I request the readers to send me their questions, which I would be glad to answer in the next issue. @sgurumurthy 
Greetings to the readers of Thuglak as the magazine marks its 49th anniversary. I also pay my tributes to the fearless and phenomenal Cho Ramaswamy, who nurtured Thuglak and took it to new heights. 
I want your direct feedback on various issues‚Ä¶take part in the survey on the ‚ÄòNarendra Modi Mobile App.' 
Have a great Lohri! 
The BJP is the party that can cater to the aspirations of the first time voter. Such a voter wants development and not dynasty. Such a voter wants performance and not promises. Hence, we seek their blessings. 
Tamil Nadu has a strong MSME sector and we are proud of the spirit of enterprise the state is blessed with. A BJP Karyakarta asked me about the NDA government‚Äôs efforts for the sector. Here‚Äôs what I said. 
Made a request to BJP Karyakartas from all over India. Know what it is. 
A fruitful interaction with Tamil Nadu BJP Karyakartas. Watch. 
Releasing a commemorative coin in honour of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. 
We have come a long way. Back in the day, aeroplanes would wait to escort middlemen who were close to one party and one family. Now, middlemen are being forced to return to India. What they looted will have to be returned and those for whom they looted will be punished. 
There is a Common Process, and there is a Congress Process. The Congress Process encouraged favouritism, corruption, nepotism and compromised India‚Äôs welfare. After coming to power, we transformed the processes and the results are for everyone to see. 
We want India‚Äôs youth to express and excel. The Government is creating an environment that gives our Yuva Shakti the platform to showcase their skills as well as talents. 
Addressing the @BJP4India meeting in Delhi. Watch. 
The thoughts and ideals of #SwamiVivekananda inspire and energise crores of Indians, particularly our youth. It is from him that we draw the motivation of building an India that is strong, vibrant, inclusive and an India that takes global leadership in several areas. 
‚ÄúArise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached.‚Äù Remembering these powerful words, and the rich thoughts of the venerable #SwamiVivekananda on his Jayanti. He emphasised on the ideals of service and renunciation. His belief in Yuva Shakti was unwavering. 
Attended the @BJP4India National Convention in Delhi today. 
A TN BJP Karyakarta asked me about the record corruption in the Congress years, which was implicitly admitted by a former PM of their party and the honest, pro-people governance under NDA. This is what I said to him. 
UPA did not bother about our defence sector. They were always looking for deals, and so, naturally the nation suffered. 
I consider it my privilege that I got the opportunity to work for my sisters and brothers of Tamil Nadu. Here are some of the efforts undertaken by the Central Government. 
Collect, verify and correct. Know what I said about how more technology has made access to information easier but also places a great responsibility on us. 
A BJP Karyakarta asked me about possible alliances in Tamil Nadu. Here is what I said. 
Commendable decisions taken by the GST council, which will greatly help MSMEs, traders and the services sector. We remain committed to a simple and people-friendly GST. 
Talking to BJP Karyakartas from Tamil Nadu. Watch the interaction. 
It is in the Himalayas that I learnt about oneness with nature. The mighty mountains also taught me the importance of humility. Here is the second part of my chat with @HumansOfBombay, where I talk about an interesting phase of my life. 
By passing The Constitution (One Hundred And Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Bill, 2019, we pay tributes to the makers of our Constitution and the great freedom fighters, who envisioned an India that is strong and inclusive. 
Passage of The Constitution (One Hundred And Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Bill, 2019 in both Houses of Parliament is a victory for social justice. It ensures a wider canvas for our Yuva Shakti to showcase their prowess and contribute towards India‚Äôs transformation. 
Delighted the Rajya Sabha has passed The Constitution (One Hundred And Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Bill, 2019. Glad to see such widespread support for the Bill. The House also witnessed a vibrant debate, where several members expressed their insightful opinions. 
These pictures from Agra indicate the affection towards BJP. The working of the Central Government and UP Government have endeared our Party to the people. Opportunist alliances will never be accepted by people. 
We are not only cleaning our villages and cities but also the corridors of power from the dirt of corruption and middlemen. No wonder, those who think it‚Äôs their divine right to rule dislike me vehemently. I will continue to clean the system and ensure transparency. 
Those who remained in power for several decades never accorded priority to ensuring housing for all. On the contrary, their lack of concern forced people to be homeless. The last 4 years witnessed record construction of houses, guided by a people-centric approach. 
Sharing some pictures from the massive gathering in Solapur. 
More sports, better health and a fitter nation! #5MinuteAur is a great effort that will further fitness levels across India. It‚Äôs also wonderful to see noted athletes talk about their own experiences vis-√†-vis spending more time on the field. @kheloindia 
My best wishes to all young friends taking part in the Khelo India Youth Games, which are beginning in Pune today. May this tournament showcase the best sporting talent and give our youth a platform to fulfil their sporting dreams. @kheloindia 
Furthering ‚ÄòEase of Living‚Äô for people of Agra through development works. Watch my speech. 
Hello Solapur! Glad to be in this wonderful city. Addressing a public meeting. Watch. 
We are resolutely committed to the principle of ‚ÄòSabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.‚Äô It is our endeavour to ensure that every poor person, irrespective of caste or creed gets to lead a life of dignity, and gets access to all possible opportunities. 
I thank MPs from all the parties who supported The Constitution (One Hundred And Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Bill, 2019 in the Lok Sabha. I also appreciate those MP colleagues who enriched today‚Äôs debate with their views. 
The passage of The Constitution (One Hundred And Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Bill, 2019 in the Lok Sabha is a landmark moment in our nation‚Äôs history. It sets into motion the process to achieve an effective measure that ensures justice for all sections of society. 
Attended the Inaugural Session of #Raisina2019, addressed by PM @erna_solberg. She shared insightful views on several subjects. @raisinadialogue 
In Agra, the foundation stones for the following projects will be laid: Integrated Command and Control Centre for Agra Smart City. Upgradation of SN Medical College, Agra. Various other development projects. 
Tomorrow, I look forward to being among the people of Agra. The Gangajal Project pertaining to water supply will be inaugurated. It will improve the water supply, benefiting Agra residents and tourists. Projects relating to health, sanitation, education will also be inaugurated. 
My discussions with PM @erna_solberg revolved around fulfilling Sustainable Development Goals, boost economic times, aspects of the ocean economy and deepening cultural ties. India and Norway look forward to cooperating on a wide range of issues, for the benefit of our citizens. 
During my recent visit to Mumbai, I sat down with the team of @HumansOfBombay and interacted with them about aspects of my life. Here is the first of the five part series. 
The development projects will improve connectivity in Solapur and surrounding areas. The housing project will particularly help Beedi and textile workers. Sanitation and sewerage facilities will also improve. We are committed to furthering ‚ÄòEase of Living‚Äô for our citizens. 
The foundation stones of the following works will also be laid in Solapur: Underground Sewerage System under AMRUT Mission. Improvement in Water Supply and Sewerage System. Augmentation of Drinking Water Supply from Ujani Dam to Solapur City. These will greatly benefit citizens. 
I look forward to visiting Solapur tomorrow in connection with following development works: Dedication of four-laning of Solapur-Osmanabad section of NH-211. Foundation Stone of 30,000 houses under PMAY. Launch of underground Sewerage System, and three Sewage Treatment Plants. 
Looking good, @ianuragthakur! 
Dear Hrithik, praying for the good health of Shri Rakesh Roshan Ji. He is a fighter and I am sure he will face this challenge with utmost courage. @RakeshRoshan_N 
Addressing the press with PM @erna_solberg. We had fruitful talks on strengthening India-Norway ties. 
A historic cricketing accomplishment in Australia! Congratulations to the Indian Cricket Team for the hard-fought and richly deserved series victory. The series witnessed some memorable performances and solid teamwork. Best wishes for the various games ahead. 
Never underestimate a BJP Karyakarta. Our party is guided by the motive of serving Bharat Mata. We are not here for power. We aren‚Äôt here to perpetuate family rule or build a fortune. Our Karyakartas are our family. They are our fortune. 
BJP Karyakartas across AP were asking me about the interface between political parties and the media. Here‚Äôs what I said. I urge friends in the media hear it as well. I also recalled a memory from 2001 when I was working in the Party organisation. 
People across AP are realising the lies of TDP and the state government. The CM has betrayed the great NTR twice. Telugu pride is about working for the people diligently, not focusing on son-rise and corruption. 
Best wishes to Himachal Pradesh CM Shri Jairam Thakur. He has been working hard to develop Himachal Pradesh and empower the poor. I pray for his long and healthy life. @jairamthakurbjp 
Best wishes to Himachal Pradesh CM Shri Jairam Thakur. He has been working hard to develop Himachal Pradesh and empower the poor. I pray for his long and healthy life. @jairamthakurbjp 
Addressing the hardworking Andhra Pradesh BJP Karyakartas. Watch. 
Thank you Baripada for the great welcome. Here are pictures from the rally. 
Ayushman Bharat has revolutionised our health sector and is being widely praised all over. It has enabled a healthier life for the poor and downtrodden. I once again appeal to the Odisha Government to be a part of this scheme. They should forget politics and think of the poor. 
Quickening Odisha‚Äôs growth. 
Talked at length about Mission Indradhanush and how it manifests a new approach towards women and child welfare. 
The great Odia culture always gives topmost importance to women empowerment. However, the current Government in Odisha has not worked hard for the welfare of the state‚Äôs Nari Shakti. 
From Baripada in Odisha, here is how we paid tributes to the phenomenal men and women who fought valiantly for India‚Äôs freedom. 
We have transformed the housing sector. More houses are being built with better facilities, allocated without favouritism and aimed at women empowerment. Congress built few houses, allowed middlemen to make merry and named schemes after members of one family! 
Odisha supports BJP‚Äôs development agenda. Speaking at a huge rally in Baripada. Watch. 
Enhancing Jharkhand‚Äôs progress, reviving key projects. Addressing a public meeting in Palamu, Jharkhand. 
A few days ago, we took a historic decision for the people of Assam. This will go a long way in preserving the unique culture of Assam. 
The Citizenship Amendment Bill of 2016 is a sincere attempt to remove the injustices done in the past. 
My categorical assurance to my sisters and brothers of Assam regarding the NRC. 
In Imphal, paid tributes to the rich history and culture of Manipur including the bravery of people from this land in the freedom struggle. Also talked about efforts to create better sporting infrastructure for the state‚Äôs youth. 
A paradigm shift in the way projects are initiated and completed. Happy to share that work on several projects, including the FCI Food Storage Godown at Sawombung started after 2014 and they have been completed. This ensures fast paced development. 
The Integrated Check Post at Moreh, which has been inaugurated today will offer a wide range of facilities to the people. The Dolaithabi Barrage project was conceived in 1987 but work began at full pace only after 2014 and it was inaugurated today. 
When it comes to the development of the Northeast, our Government has left no stone unturned. The contrast with previous Congress Governments, and the result of our efforts are for everyone to see. 
Defence Minister @nsitharaman's speech in the Parliament demolishes the campaign of calumny on Rafale. Must watch! 
Shri @arunjaitley's intervention on Jammu Kashmir is incisive and informative. Do watch! 
Happy to be among the people of Assam. Watch my speech at Silchar. 
A boost to Manipur's growth. Inaugurating key development projects in Imphal. Watch. 
Excellent! Congratulations to @sinha_arunima for scaling new heights of success. She is the pride of India, who has distinguished herself through her hardwork and perseverance. Wishing her the very best for her future endeavours. 
During the Cabinet meeting yesterday, a landmark decision was taken that benefits the MSME sector. Know more... 
Our approach to GST has always been people friendly. We have always sought feedback from various stakeholders and have acted on that feedback too. In the coming times too, this approach will remain the same. We are making GST as simple as possible. 
Rewards, Congres style! If one is associated with the 1984 anti-Sikh massacre, one gets to become MP, CM thanks to Congress. Instead of focussing on public welfare, their interest lies more in ensuring people do not sing Vande Mataram. Very sad... 
With the blessings of the people and the earnest desire to ensure more pilgrims can pray to Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the NDA government has worked on the Kartarpur corridor. We want to build an India that is inspired by the values of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji. 
2018 was a great year for Indian science. Our nation achieved a lot and we must do a lot more in the years to come so that science continues to enhance India‚Äôs progress. 
India‚Äôs history in science, technology and innovation will make every Indian proud. A century ago, with minimum resources and maximum struggles our scientists did extraordinary things. 
Here are some pictures from the 106th Indian Science Congress. 
Great euphoria at the huge rally in Gurdaspur. Here is my speech. 
Speaking on ‚ÄòFuture India: Science and Technology‚Äô at the 106th Indian Science Congress. Watch. 
Our party is blessed to have the support of such hard-working volunteers. My best wishes to everyone. Happy volunteering :) 
The Ujjwala Yojana continues to transform lives, emerging as an agent of change for the poor. Delighted that the number of beneficiaries has crossed 6 crore. Congratulations to the beneficiaries. The Yojana is ensuring women empowerment and better health in our society. 
A very emotional moment from today‚Äôs interaction with @BJP4Andhra Karyakartas‚Ä¶ We were honoured that Shri P V Chalapathi Rao Garu joined the interaction. The wisdom and hardwork of Karyakartas like him have no parallel. They are the strength of the BJP! 
Karyakartas told me how NTR Garu referred to Congress as 'Dushta Congress' but for TDP today, it is 'Dost Congress.‚Äô People know the reality of TDP and Congress. Based on our work in the last 4.5 years, I can confidently say that it is BJP that will fulfil AP‚Äôs aspirations. 
To hide their own failures, the TDP Government in AP is spreading so many lies. BJP‚Äôs truth will defeat the Tsunami of TDP‚Äôs lies. It is high time the AP Government answer the people of the state on their own misdoings. 
Several members of the Telugu community have prospered overseas. Thus, it was natural for a Karyakarta from Andhra Pradesh to ask about the foreign policy of India and express joy about India‚Äôs rising stature at the world stage. 
Caring for every Indian, providing national, financial and healthcare security to our citizens. Know what I told a Karyakarta from Machilipatnam on the unique work culture of the NDA Government. 
The 2019 polls are special because those born in the 21st century will also vote. Requested first time voters to bless @BJP4India and talked about why the BJP‚Äôs development agenda strikes a chord with people from all sections of society. 
Having a wonderful interaction with the hardworking @BJP4Andhra Karyakartas. Watch. 
Looking forward to interacting with @BJP4Andhra Karyakartas at 4 PM. Do watch. 
In case you missed it, here is my interview with @ANI. Have spoken about a wide range of issues. Watch! 
Kader Khan Ji brightened the screen with his stupendous acting skills and lightened it thanks to his unique sense of humour. He was also a prolific screenwriter, associated with many memorable films. Saddened by his demise. Condolences to his family and admirers. 
Best wishes to Manipur‚Äôs dynamic CM Shri @NBirenSingh Ji on his birthday. He is working tirelessly for the development of the state. I pray for his long and healthy life. 
Wishing everyone a joyous 2019! May everyone be happy and healthy. I pray that all your wishes are fulfilled in 2019. 
Had a good interaction with the newly elected Mayors from Haryana. Congratulated them and conveyed my best wishes as they begin their work in fulfilling the aspirations of the people of their respective cities. @BJP4Haryana 
Excellent effort! Proud of our Party Karyakartas who are working tirelessly. 
Happy to know! My best wishes to you. 
Yes I agree. I urge more people to visit Prayagraj and take part in the Kumbh. 
When Jabalpur has passionate citizens like you, no force can prevent this city from being Swachh. 
Thank you. This is a mark of respect for the brave Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and all that he did for our nation. 
Met Gujarat Cabinet Minister Shri Kunvarjibhai Bavaliya. Congratulated him on his win in the Jasdan by-poll and conveyed my best wishes in his endeavours towards serving the people of Gujarat and further strengthening @BJP4Gujarat. 
Reiterated India's continued commitment to work together for the development of Bangladesh and further strengthening of our bilateral relations. 
Spoke to Sheikh Hasina Ji and congratulated her on the resounding victory in the Bangladesh elections. Wished her the very best for the tenure ahead. 
Thank you 2018 for making us happy and proud. 
These pictures show the high level of enthusiasm at the public meeting in Port Blair. 
An initiative that will boost industrial growth in Andaman and Nicobar islands, as well as Lakshadweep. 
It is important for us as a nation to be proud of our rich history and those who toiled for our freedom. The response of the people of Andaman and Nicobar islands to a decision taken by the Government must be seen to be believed! 
Today, the people of Andaman and Nicobar islands got many development projects. The progress of these islands is our priority. I do not agree with any differentiation between mainland and island‚Ä¶Andaman and Nicobar is as mainland as any other part of India. 
75 years ago, on this day, in the city of Port Blair, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose addressed a large gathering. Today, we paid tributes to Netaji in a unique way. Watch. 
In 1943 Netaji Bose unfurled the Tricolour in Andaman and Nicobar islands. Today in Port Blair, I had the honour of unfurling the Tricolour to mark the 75th anniversary of Subhas Babu's brave feat. We also reiterate our commitment to creating an India Subhas Babu dreamt of. 
Among those imprisoned at Cellular Jail was the great Veer Savarkar. I visited the cell where the indomitable Veer Savarkar was lodged. Rigorous imprisonment did not dampen Veer Savarkar‚Äôs spirits and he continued to speak and write about a free India from jail too. 
Cellular Jail...this is where colonial rulers sent several nationalists and freedom fighters who fiercely resisted imperialism. Today, I had the privilege of visiting the Cellular Jail and paying homage to those greats who toiled for us and our freedom. 
There is immense fervour at the public meeting in Port Blair. Watch my speech live. 
Paid homage to those who lost their lives in the unfortunate 2004 Tsunami at the Tsunami Memorial in Car Nicobar. 
Have a look at the vibrancy in Car Nicobar. These are some pictures from the public meeting, where I got the opportunity to interact with citizens from all walks of life. 
Central Government‚Äôs efforts such as Sagarmala will have an extremely positive impact on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. At the same time, we are working towards a Trans-shipment Port that will boost economic prospects. Connectivity will also be enhanced. 
Happy to announce important decisions relating to agriculture and fisheries. These will help protect local culture of the Andaman and Nicobar islands as well as increase livelihood opportunities. 
Giving wings to the aspirations of our Yuva Shakti. The upcoming ITI will greatly benefit youngsters. The Government is building vital sporting infrastructure, which will further popularize sports in the UT and boost fitness levels. 
Today in Car Nicobar, we inaugurated and laid the foundation stones for several development works. These are projects relating to education, healthcare, skill development, transportation, energy and sports. Congratulations to the citizens! 
Our country is grateful to Shri Mrinal Sen for giving us some of the most memorable films. The dexterity and sensitivity with which he made films is noteworthy. His rich work is admired across generations. Saddened by his demise. My thoughts are with his family and admirers. 
Appreciated the role of websites like in inspiring positivity in society. I urge you to share such efforts that you know of, and further positivity. 
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Madiba! As we mark the 150th Jayanti of Bapu and the birth centenary of Madiba, we recall their ideals and reiterate our commitment to create a just and compassionate society. 
Spoke about a unique award named after Sardar Patel, that will further the spirit of unity and integration. #MannKiBaat 
In January 2019, the holy city of Prayagraj will host the Kumbh Mela. This is an important event, one with deep historical roots and an occasion for self-discovery. Do visit Prayagraj for the Kumbh and do share your photos on social media. #MannKiBaat 
Our festivals are occasions of celebrating togetherness. They also illustrate a deep connect with Mother Nature. 
Happy to be connecting once again, thanks to #MannKiBaat. Tune in. 
I thank the people of Tripura for their massive support to BJP in the civic polls. Gladdening to see the hard-work and efforts of karyakartas of @BJP4Tripura. This will give a further boost to the development of Tripura. 
Our Digital India initiative has brought convenience in the lives of crores of Indians and has also helped eliminate corruption. 
‚ÄòOne District, One Product‚Äô is a commendable initiative of the Uttar Pradesh Government, which will safeguard the well-being of all those associated with MSMEs, especially weaving and handicrafts. 
It is a matter of pride for Kashi that this great city is now home to the International Rice Research Institute South Asia Regional Centre. This Centre harnesses the power of technology and innovation for the benefit of our farmers. Glimpses from the inauguration today. 
Boosting the development of Kashi and UP. Addressing a programme in Varanasi. 
The moment Governments changed in MP and Rajasthan, urea shortages began and so have Lathis on farmers. In Karnataka, farmers are suffering. On what basis is Congress talking about farmer welfare? The NDA govt. is taking many steps for a robust agriculture sector. 
Wonderful to be in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh. Watch my speech at the public meeting. 
India is delighted to welcome @PMBhutan Dr. Lotay Tshering. We had fruitful talks, focused on deepening cooperation in hydropower, space technology, economy and several other areas. Strong ties between our nations greatly benefit our citizens. 
Harnessing the demographic dividend and empowering our Yuva Shakti. 
Spoke about how one can volunteer for the 2019 poll campaign and why we deeply value the efforts as well as insights of volunteers. 
India is witnessing an increased arrival of tourists, which augurs well for our economy. Talked about the steps taken in the tourism sector while interacting with a Karyakarta from Davanagere. 
A Karyakarta from Bidar asked me about the steps taken by the Government for the MSME sector. This is what I said... 
In Karnataka, those in power are only bothered about ministries and portfolios. Public welfare is not their concern. In such an atmosphere, the @BJP4Karnataka Karyakartas must continue being among people and highlight their issues. 
Speaking on a wide range of issues with our Karnataka BJP Karyakartas. Watch. 
Looking forward to interacting with @BJP4Karnataka Karyakartas this evening. Watch the interaction on the 'Narendra Modi Mobile App.' 
Addressing a joint press meet with Dr. Lotay Tshering, the PM of Bhutan. @PMBhutan 
Birthday wishes to my valued colleague Shri @arunjaitley Ji. He has made a valuable contribution as our Finance Minister. He has also distinguished himself as a great Parliamentarian. Praying for his long and healthy life. 
Congress is a master at misleading farmers. Their fake promises and tokenism will not cut ice with the hardworking farmers of India. 
Know how the emphasis on next-generation infrastructure will have a positive impact on the people of Himachal Pradesh. 
Here are pictures from the public meeting in Dharamshala. I congratulate the Himachal Pradesh Government under CM Shri Jairam Thakur on completing one year of providing good governance to the people of the state. @jairamthakurbjp 
Looking forward to being in Devbhoomi Himachal Pradesh tomorrow for a @BJP4Himachal rally in Dharamshala. You can watch the rally on the ‚ÄòNarendra Modi Mobile App.‚Äô 
Assamese is a great language and the culture of Assam is special. 
Connectivity will lead to more opportunity, which will enhance prosperity. 
Absolutely! More bright engineers who will contribute to India's progress. 
We are happy that we have got the opportunity to work for the development of Eastern and Northeastern India. Our efforts are transforming lives in these regions. 
Saddened by the demise of Padma Shri Sulagitti Narasamma Ji. Her efforts of providing midwifery services in Karnataka will always be remembered. Her kindness endeared her to the poorer sections of society. My thoughts are with her family and vast number of admirers. 
Rashtrapati Ji led the nation in paying tributes to the venerable Atal Ji at 'Sadaiv Atal‚Äô, which is Atal Ji‚Äôs Samadhi. India is eternally grateful to Atal Ji for everything he has done for the nation. 
Have a look at these pictures of the Bogibeel Bridge. 
Misgovernance and corruption most adversely impact the poor. On various parameters, compare the working of the NDA with the previous Government. Ours is a Government that has diligently worked to fulfil the dreams of the poor. 
At the core of good governance is compassion, and taking steps that bring a positive difference in the lives of the poor. 
A developed Eastern India is essential for a developed India. The NDA Government‚Äôs efforts will usher in record transformation for Eastern India. 
From bigger roads, rail connectivity to better healthcare facilities, the Northeast is witnessing a great transformation during the last four years. 
It is indeed an honour to have inaugurated the Bogibeel Bridge on Atal Ji's Jayanti. After all, he was really keen that this project see the light of day. This and several other critical infra projects that were delayed for years are getting completed under the NDA Government. 
The Bogibeel Bridge is among the most state-of-the-art infra projects in India. It will deepen connectivity and open new avenues of prosperity for citizens. 
A historic day for the Northeast! Speaking at the inauguration of the Bogibeel Bridge. Watch. 
Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas. We remember the noble teachings of Jesus Christ and recall his efforts towards creating a compassionate and equal society. 
Spent three peaceful, happy days in Varanasi with my Loyola School class mates. What struck me the most: 1. The ghats of Banaras have never been so spotlessly clean. 2. Ganga looks pristine. Achieving both goals in less than 5 years must have been a Herculean task. #Varanasi2018 
The people of Odisha have many serious questions for the State Government. They want to know why is the State Government not solving people‚Äôs problems, despite being in power for so many years... 
While the NDA Government is taking several steps for the welfare of farmers, the Odisha Government is insensitive to their needs and ignores their wellbeing. 
The Central Government is extremely sensitive towards the dreams of the wonderful people of Odisha. There is a strong focus on infrastructure, connectivity, healthcare, social sectors and more. 
Pictures from the massive rally in Khurda. There is a strong demand for change in Odisha. The people of the state are convinced that if there is one party that can fulfil people‚Äôs aspirations, it is @BJP4Odisha. 
Honouring those who gave their life for India‚Äôs freedom. The Paika Rebellion was a watershed moment in our history. It demonstrated the valour of the Odia people. Today, released a stamp and coin on the Paika Rebellion and remembered the greats who fought colonial rule. 
Today in Odisha, also launched pipelines of @IndianOilcl and @gailindia. These projects will ensure more petroleum products for the citizens of Odisha. 
Improving connectivity in Odisha by focussing in better road network across the state. 
The new ESIC hospital will serve my sisters and brothers of Odisha. Larger in capacity and better in facilities, it will contribute towards building a healthier Odisha. 
Glad to have dedicated to the nation the campus of IIT Bhubaneswar. The coming of such a prestigious institution augurs well for youngsters of Odisha. 
Inaugurated the Lalitgiri Museum. I am sure this Museum will beautifully showcase facets of Odisha's spectacular culture and history. Announced the setting up of the Buxi Jagabandhu research chair at Utkal University. This will help students researching on the Paika Rebellion. 
Being in Odisha is special. Today, I had the honour of inaugurating and laying the foundation stones for numerous projects worth Rs. 14,000 crore. The Central Government is committed towards doing everything possible for Odisha's progress. 
Today, on the eve of beloved Atal Ji's Jayanti, a commemorative coin was released in his honour. Widely respected by everyone, Atal Ji's strong leadership ensured great progress for our country. He was a leader who put national interest above everything. 
Euphoric atmosphere at the @BJP4Odisha rally in Khurda. Watch. 
Saddened by the demise of Captain Jai Narain Prasad Nishad Ji. He served our nation with great diligence. Captain Nishad‚Äôs efforts for the progress of Bihar were noteworthy. His work towards empowering the poor will always be remembered. Condolences to his family and supporters. 
Maa Ganga is central to our history and culture. She has nurtured us for years. It‚Äôs our honour that we‚Äôve been able to undertake such a massive exercise towards ensuring a Clean Ganga. These efforts will further intensify in the times to come. 
I salute your passion for India‚Äôs growth and thank you for the faith in our Government. When we have well wishers like you, I am sure we will be able to convey our work to the people with great effectiveness. 
Congratulations! 
Saddened by the loss of lives and destruction in Indonesia caused by the Tsunami after the eruption of a volcano. Condolences to the bereaved families and wishing the injured an early recovery. India is ready to assist our maritime neighbour and friend in relief work. @jokowi 
A Karyakarta from Tiruvallur wanted to know: What has the Government done for senior citizens? Know what I told him. 
How was 2018 for India? This is what a Karyakarta from Tiruchirappalli asked me. Here is what I said. 
People of Madurai are pleased that their historic city will have an AIIMS. A Karyakarta from Madurai asked me about Tamil Nadu‚Äôs development trajectory in the times to come. 
Here is how the family of @BJP4India Karyakartas can enhance their efforts towards ensuring a record win for the Party in 2019. 
Many Mahagathbandhan leaders are ardent followers of Dr. Lohia. By allying with Congress, they are disrespecting his ideals. People will also never forget how Congress humiliated greats like MGR and NTR. Opposition‚Äôs only interest is dynasty, not development. 
Sardar Patel devoted his life towards unifying India. The Sardar Patel Award for National Integration will be a fitting tribute to him and will inspire more people to work towards furthering India‚Äôs unity and national integration. 
Yesterday, at the DGPs/IGPs Conference in Kevadia, announced an annual Sardar Patel Award for National Integration. This award would be given for outstanding efforts to further national integration. 
Remembering Chaudhary Charan Singh Ji on his birth anniversary. We recall his noteworthy contribution to India's development, particularly in safeguarding the interests of farmers. He also fiercely resisted the Emergency and worked to strengthen our democratic fabric. 
I thank the people of Jasdan for blessing the BJP and supporting the Party's development agenda. Congratulations to Kunvarjibhai Bavaliya for the victory. Kudos to the @BJP4Gujarat team, CM @vijayrupanibjp and @jitu_vaghani for their efforts. 
Our Karyakartas are the biggest strength of the BJP. Watch the interaction with Tamil Nadu Karyakartas. 
We are determined to improve the health of women across India. At the @BJPMahilaMorcha meet, talked about some of the work done in this direction. 
Over the last four and a half years, lot of effort has been devoted towards women empowerment. Nari Shakti has been at the core of several initiatives of our Government. 
Since the days of the Jana Sangh, women Karyakartas have played a pivotal role in the Party. I commend the @BJPMahilaMorcha for their endeavours and wish them the very best for their efforts in the times to come. 
Need of the hour for the police forces is to use latest technology including social media. Lots can also be done in capacity building in the area of cyber security. 
There are elements who are exploiting caste fault-lines for their short term gains. It is important that police forces tackle such forces and preserve the united fabric of our country. 
The efforts of our police forces in countering terrorism are commendable. At the DGPs/IGPs conference, spoke about the need for police forces to be vigilant and counter the forces of radicalisation. Also highlighted the need to strengthen inter-state coordination to tackle crime. 
Shared my thoughts on a wide range of issues concerning our security systems and the working of the police forces at the DGPs/IGPs Conference in Kevadia. 
Addressing the National Convention of @BJP4India Mahila Morcha. Watch. 
Sharing some glimpses from the wonderful cultural programme at the DGPs/IGPs Conference at Kevadia. 
During the Conference of DGPs and IGPs, I‚Äôve also got the opportunity to meet select groups of officials and discuss specific issues pertaining to policing and security. 
It‚Äôs been a productive day at the Conference of DGPs/IGPs in Kevadia. We‚Äôve been having detailed presentations on various aspects relating to national security. 
With the passing away of Dipali Barthakur Ji, we have lost an outstanding singer who made Assamese music and culture even more popular across India and the world. Her melodious songs will continue to enthral generations to come. Condolences to her family and countless admirers. 
Chennai based Dr S Jayachandran is a hero. His was a life purely for the betterment of others. 
I would specially urge you all to visit Kevadia and see the ‚ÄòStatue of Unity.‚Äô Some friends told me that the Statue can also be seen during Delhi-Mumbai flights. So, next time you are flying that route do try to spot the Statue. 
Paid tributes to the great Sardar Patel at the ‚ÄòStatue of Unity.‚Äô As India‚Äôs Home Minister, his contribution towards building the framework of our security systems is immense. 
Reached Kevadia in Gujarat for the Conference of DGPs/IGPs. Looking forward to fruitful deliberations that will strengthen our security apparatus. 
Do you have an idea for this month‚Äôs #MannKiBaat on the 30th? Share it on the MyGov Open Forum. You can also dial 1800 11 7800 and record your message. The NM Mobile App has a section as well to share inputs. 
The high voter turnout in the polls clearly displays immense faith that people of J&amp;K have put in grass root democratic institutions of the country. Essence of democracy lies in empowerment of the common citizen, to which our government is totally committed. 
These elected Sarpanches are extraordinary individuals who have shown immense courage in the face of heavy odds. They have made an everlasting contribution towards enhancing the democratic fabric of the state. Assured them full support from the Centre in their many efforts. 
Had an excellent interaction with newly elected Sarpanches of Panchayats from across Jammu and Kashmir. Wished them the very best as they work towards fulfilling the aspirations of the people. 
I commend the @BJP4Haryana team for assiduously working for people's welfare. Under the leadership of Shri @mlkhattar Ji, the state government has been providing corruption-free and people-friendly governance to the state. BJP's development agenda is being widely appreciated. 
Haryana trusts BJP! I thank the people of Haryana for continuously reposing their faith in @BJP4Haryana. We derive great strength from the people‚Äôs blessings and reaffirm our commitment to work for Haryana‚Äôs progress. 
Having an interesting interaction with BJP Karyakartas based in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Watch. 
Will be interacting with @BJP4TamilNadu and @BJP4Puducherry Karyakartas at 4:30 this evening. Watch the interaction live on the 'Narendra Modi Mobile App.' 
Leveraging the power of technology to bring a positive difference in the lives of 130 crore Indians. 
‚ÄòEase of Living‚Äô for people is our aim. Resources are being devoted towards creating urban centres where the development is holistic. 
From Kargil to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, there is a lot of work happening towards building next generation infrastructure. I salute all those working towards completing these projects. 
Work on the Pune Metro is moving at a quick pace and this augurs well for the people of Pune and surrounding areas. 
Housing for all is among the topmost priorities of our Government. With one's own home comes dignity and the ability to fulfil one's aspirations. 
Furthering connectivity and convenience for the hardworking citizens of Mumbai and Thane. 
Mumbai, Thane and the surrounding regions play a crucial role in India‚Äôs progress. The Central and Maharashtra Government are taking many steps for the growth of these places. Today, laid the foundation stones for projects worth Rs. 33,000 crore, including 2 Metro Lines. 
Happy to see the passion among members of the film and entertainment industry towards the development of India. They talked at length about ways to further Mumbai‚Äôs development, particularly with regard to making it a global hub for entertainment. 
Had an extensive and fruitful interaction with a delegation from the film and entertainment industry. The delegation spoke about the strides being made by the film and entertainment industry, and gave valuable inputs relating to GST for their sector. 
In Mumbai today, released the book ‚ÄòTimeless Laxman.‚Äô This book is based on the life of the great RK Laxman, whose rich work and indomitable spirit continue to be admired and remembered by every Indian. 
Pune's vibrancy is widely admired. This is a city of culture and learning. Addressing a public meeting here. Watch. 
GST marks a historic leap for the nation. We firmly believe that GST must be as simple as possible and we are also working constantly in that direction. 
Here is an example of how the work culture has changed in India today, indicative of a Surging India. 
It was 40 years ago today when I gave the very first speech on @cspan in Congress. Since, there have been many changes in media, but transparency, open government, and civil discourse remain critical to the success of our democracy -- and CSPAN has helped! 
Led by the inspiring @GretaThunberg and @ClimateReality leader @havenruthie in the U.S, students are fighting like their world depends on it. I stand with all students striking here in Atlanta and across world today. #YouthClimateStrike #FridaysForFuture 
Heartbreaking to wake up this morning to the tragic hate crime that occured last night in New Zealand. My deepest sympathies and prayers are with the Al Noor and Linwood mosques and the rest of New Zealand. We must stand together against bigotry and hatred across the world. 
Powerful meeting tonight at the historic @ebenezer_atl with @RevDrBarber, Rev. @RaphaelWarnock and other faith leaders for 'A Moral Call to Action on the Climate Crisis'. Thank you so much to everyone who came out to make your voices heard! #LeadOnClimate 
In 1991, the High Performance Computing Act paved the way for what used to be known as the ‚ÄúInformation Superhighway.‚Äù I was proud to write the legislation and to help ensure the Internet supports a free democracy, a standard we must continue to protect. #Web30 #ForTheWeb 
Fossil fuels represent the energy of the past. To protect its economy from the risk of stranded assets, Norway will begin to divest its $1 trillion wealth fund from oil investments. The future is clean, renewable energy, and Norway gets it. 
There are too many vivid and stark examples of what @RevDrBarber calls ‚Äúecological devastation.‚Äù This past fall, Bishop Barber, @KarennaGore and I visited a community in NC where residents are coping with stored coal ash leaching into their water systems: 
Communities in my home state of Tennessee are being impacted in places like Kingston: 
This is an important report about coal ash contaminating drinking water sources across America. I‚Äôve recently seen first-hand the impacts of coal ash pollution on low-income communities, where these power plants are often located. 
Last week, @RevDrBarber and I continued our tour of the South to hear from and stand with communities impacted by ecological injustices. Join us by signing our petition to commit to ending environmental devastation and racism. 
Mother Nature is speaking, and more and more Republicans are rightly listening. Good for @JohnKasich to realize the folly of denying the science of the climate crisis, and to call on his party to support meaningful action. 
Excited to have XQ Super School in my home town of Nashville this Saturday! @XQAmerica is celebrating innovative heroes transforming America‚Äôs high schools. Learn more: #XQLive 
We‚Äôre hearing powerful testimonies here in Lowndes County, AL about the ecological injustices happening here and throughout the state. You are not alone. We stand with you and will continue to. 
My tour with @RevDrBarber and @KarennaGore continues today in Hayneville, Alabama where we‚Äôll learn from, and stand in support of residents suffering from exposure to raw sewage and coal ash. If you‚Äôre in the area, come join us. 
Tune in now to join @RevDrBarber, @KarennaGore and myself for our public forum in Union Hill, VA: the Moral Call for Ecological Justice 
For too long, fossil fuel companies have taken advantage of minority communities, exposing them to harmful toxic pollution. The historic Union Hill community in Virginia is fighting back for ecological and social justice. #WeAreAllUnionHill. 
The world recently lost two true giants in the field of environmental science and research. Here‚Äôs my statement on the legacies of Wally Broecker and Walter Munk. 
.@dwallacewells' @NYMag piece sparked a crucial dialogue about the worsening impacts of the climate crisis in a powerful way. His new book #TheUninhabitableEarth has enormous potential to energize an even larger audience to act with the immediacy this crisis requires. 
Proud to be joining @RevDrBarber and my daughter @KarennaGore tomorrow in Union Hill, VA to stand with this historic community fighting environmental racism. #WeAreAllUnionHill. 
Thrilled for my good friend and former advisor @dongips on his new exciting role as CEO of the @SkollFoundation! Excellent choice of leadership for Skoll‚Äôs important work in solving our planet's most pressing challenges. 
Well-deserved recognition for @MichaelEMann on being awarded the 2019 Tyler Prize for his pioneering research and excellent ability to communicate about the climate crisis! Congrats, Mike! 
Great to be with my friend @DaleyForMayor today! He will do an outstanding job as Mayor of Chicago. 
Here's my statement on today's Green New Deal Resolution: 
.@NASAGISS just confirmed that the past 5 years were the 5 hottest ever recorded. This also means that 18 of the 19 hottest years have occurred since 2000. It‚Äôs clear: The climate crisis is still getting worse faster than we are yet implementing the solutions. 
The President doesn‚Äôt get it. Solar wind represent the fastest growing job sectors. Costs of renewable electricity are declining rapidly. There is a Global Sustainability Revolution happening he‚Äôs boasting about more dirty outdated oil and natural gas projects? #SOTU 
20 states have joined the @USClimate Alliance, representing nearly half of the U.S. population and GDP. Welcome IL, NM, and MI! State by state, Americans clearly want the U.S. to remain a leader in solving the climate crisis. 
ICYMI: Great interactive reporting by @washingtonpost telling stories of how the climate crisis is impacting Americans today. 
As scientists have warned! Record-breaking glacial melt from the Antarctic Thwaites Glacier is responsible for about 4% of global sea-level rise. Real News! 
The application deadline for the next @ClimateReality Leadership training has been extended to Feb. 7. Join me in Atlanta, along with climate scientists and social justice experts to learn grassroots climate activism: #LeadOnClimate 
At the risk of repeating myself, may I say: I have an enormous amount of respect for Max Boot? Thank you for your integrity. 
Extreme weather and drought are two ways the climate crisis exacerbates the growing refugee and security crises around the world. Solving these crises requires action to solve the climate crisis. 
Calling all candidates! A record majority of Americans recognize our need to solve the climate crisis as it impacts their communities and loved ones. This is the greatest issue of our time and voters know it. 
I'm so inspired by the many @ClimateReality Leaders we‚Äôve trained across the globe. Join us for our 40th training in Atlanta, GA this March: #LeadOnClimate 
Fortunately, the solutions to the climate crisis can simultaneously provide solutions to a number of other major challenges we face both globally and locally. 
The climate crisis is once again ranked as the top global risk by @WEF ‚Äî after yet another year in which Mother Nature spoke to humanity loudly and clearly. 
We can't accept this as a new normal. We have all the tools we need to act and solve this. 
And this isn't going to make it any better: 
The climate crisis is having a major impact on communities around the world, including those along the particularly vulnerable US East Coast: 
Here‚Äôs a real national (and global) emergency: Greenhouse gas emissions have started increasing again. We need to urgently step up efforts to solve the climate crisis while there‚Äôs still time. 
Congratulations to this historically diverse class of representatives being sworn into Congress today. Your arrival in DC is an encouraging sign of our potential to restore balance to our government and respond to pressing issues like the climate crisis. 
Great to see the climate crisis getting increased attention from major media outlets recently. Latest example: Today‚Äôs @WashingtonPost editorial on effective ideas to combat the climate crisis: 
Thank you, @drvox for this thoughtful dose of conditional optimism on the climate crisis. 
On Christmas Eve, 50 years ago, our world was forever changed with ‚ÄòEarthrise‚Äô. After a tumultuous year, this powerful photo gave us a new perspective on our shared home. In 2019, let‚Äôs remember how fragile Earth is, and how much more we have in common than what divides us. 
The climate crisis is a public health crisis. I‚Äôll discuss this growing challenge with thought leaders, celebrities, and artists tonight on @natgeowild at 7pm ET for @ClimateReality‚Äôs one-hour special of #24HoursofReality. 
Public health should come before the profits of energy companies. Join me and the inspiring citizens, activists, and groups leading the environmental justice movement at the next @ClimateReality Leadership training this March in Atlanta, GA: 
On the heels of a productive #COP24, the EU has set a strong target to reduce carbon emissions from vehicles. This kind of policy puts words into action to meet #ParisAgreement goals. 
People from all over the world are being forced to migrate because the climate crisis is affecting their livelihood. The migrant caravan from Central America is a recent, startling example. This @FT video connects the dots in a profound way. 
ICYMI: Great aggregation of @nytimes coverage of the climate crisis in 2018. Important comprehensive overview of some of this year's best coverage on the most important challenge of our time. 
Delivered my slideshow at #COP24 today. Thanks, @UNFCCC for the invitation. The world‚Äôs scientists have issued a grim warning - we need to act with greater ambition and urgency to develop the solutions to solve the climate crisis. 
I support the Union Hill community in VA fighting this dirty fossil fuel infrastructure I support Environmental Justice. #WeAreAllUnionHill 
In March, I‚Äôll be in Atlanta to train our next class of activists to become @ClimateReality Leaders. I look forward to working with community leaders--including those from areas most vulnerable to impacts of the climate crisis. Apply now: #LeadOnClimate 
To bring global emissions down, we must demand that business political leaders urgently #ActOnClimate. It can work: A major utility committed to a zero-carbon future, responding to investment opportunity customer demand. Let‚Äôs keep the pressure on! 
Thank you so much to @ClimateReality and everyone else who was involved in this year's #24HoursofReality! I'm already looking forward to the next one! 
About to bring our 8th annual #24HoursofReality to a close with my strong support for a #GreenNewDeal, which will create jobs, invest in the right sustainable solutions protect the health of those most vulnerable. 
Our health depends on the health of the planet. That‚Äôs why world leaders must do more to address the climate crisis. Join me and demand that they strengthen their commitments to #ActOnClimate: #24HoursofReality 
LIVE NOW: 24 Hours of Reality - United States (HR-23) 
Thanks for having me on the @TODAYshow this morning!

Don‚Äôt forget to join me, @ClimateReality and all of our special guests for #24HoursofReality starting today at 9pET/6pPT! Go to to watch and learn more! 
Tomorrow is the day! Starting at 6pPT @ClimateReality and I will be joined by influencers from around the world for #24HoursofReality to talk about how our health depends on the health of the planet. 
Two days until #24HoursofReality! Make sure you join me and @ClimateReality! 
Here is my statement on the passing of President George H.W. Bush. 
#24HoursofReality is going live in 3 days. You won't want to miss it! 
Thanks @Trevornoah for having me on @TheDailyShow to talk about #24HoursofReality and how the climate crisis is impacting places like your home country of South Africa. 
Tune in to the @TheDailyShow tonight at 11pET for my interview with @Trevornoah! 
Had a fantastic visit to @AMNH's Hall of Planet Earth, which allows visitors to learn about how our climate works! This interactive exhibit should inspire all generations to learn how they can help solve the climate crisis. 
It‚Äôs a fact: Fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis and threatening our health. Tune in to #24HoursofReality on December 3‚Äì4 and learn how you can help make a difference. 
People from every ideology are being convinced by new, startling climate assessments, and by Mother Nature. I have enormous respect for @MaxBoot. It's time to hold our elected leaders accountable to the reality we are facing. 
We are addicted to coal. We can break this addiction if our leaders urgently increase ambition and scale up commitments under the Paris agreement. ICYMI, great piece from @SominiSengupta. 
My statement on the National Climate Assessment released today: 
Join me and the global network of @ClimateReality leaders working within their communities to solve the climate crisis in Atlanta this March! You can apply for our next training here: #LeadOnClimate 
The climate crisis poses a constant threat to global security. This is a threat that we face, not years from now, but today. We owe it to our brave soldiers on the front lines, and at the ready at home abroad, to recognize this threat act to solve it. 
Leaders everywhere must listen to affected communities, support Environmental Justice, and act to solve the climate crisis! 
Electricity from new wind and solar power is now cheaper than from existing coal plants in many regions of the US. The economic benefits of clean energy are here and now. 
When we protect our planet, we protect ourselves. Dec. 3rd‚Äì4th, @ClimateReality and I are hosting #24HoursofReality. We‚Äôll hear from renowned scientists and inspiring activists about how the climate crisis impacts our health‚Äìand what we can do: 
The historic flooding, droughts, hurricanes, and wildfires in 2018 were made more severe by the climate crisis. Thanks to @MichaelEMann and his colleagues, we now better understand the connections. 
Had a great conversation with @officialjaden for @Summit LA18 today! Your generation‚Äôs dedication to solving the challenges our planet faces is a hopeful sign that we will solve the climate crisis. #SUMMITLA 
I urge Colorado voters to vote #YesOn112 to protect homes, schools, playgrounds and other vulnerable areas from fracking. As oil gas spends millions to fight this, your citizen-led campaign can protect Coloradans and make climate justice history! 
Tough times call for tough leaders. That‚Äôs why I, and the extremely talented @IMKristenBell, support @EarthForAmerica. Earth's policies on clean air, clean water, and green energy jobs protect our planet and everyone on it. #BeAVoter #StandWithEarth 
Glad to see @NewYorkStateAG has moved forward with a lawsuit alleging that Exxon Mobil fraudulently covered up the impacts of the climate crisis. Companies must tell investors the truth about this growing threat and the ‚ÄúCarbon Bubble.‚Äù 
I‚Äôm always inspired by visionary ideas new technologies to accelerate scientific discovery. My friend Reed Jobs, @EmCollective, and their partners have launched @Count_Me_In to empower cancer patients to find new discoveries solutions. Learn more at 
Save trees! (plus a global transition to clean energy, of course). 
Congrats to my friend @anwaribrahim on being elected to Malaysia's parliament in a landslide victory! Overcoming the most trying times, Anwar has never wavered in his commitment to democracy. His life experience make him an excellent leader and eventual prime minister. 
I'm very much looking forward to speaking about the climate crisis at the Nobel Peace Prize Forum on Dec. 11th! This year YOU can ask climate experts at the forum questions via #ClimateQuestions2018. To learn more follow @NPPFOslo. #NPPFO 
She‚Äôs a penguin of the people and she‚Äôs got my vote. Consider this my official endorsement of Congressional candidate @EarthForAmerica. Check out her platform at and make sure to vote on Nov 6! #StandWithEarth 
My statement on the latest #IPCC Special Report: 
Congratulations to my friend @RevDrBarber on receiving the prestigious MacArthur "Genius" grant! I was fortunate to stand beside him in NC with @KarennaGore to help end ecological devastation. Dr. Barber is an exceptional leader. Nobody is more deserving. 
Another smart piece from @drvox showing how rising demand for clean energy is forcing utilities to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels. This is the power of the marketplace. WE have the power to demand 100% clean, sustainable, renewable energy. 
Proud to be a part of the @GSGimpinv in India next week to discuss how leaders can tap into the potential of the Sustainability Revolution. And, as a side benefit, they can help save the future of humanity too. #PowerOfImpact 
Important and inspiring leadership shown by the Marshall Islands -- from the frontlines of the climate crisis. Other countries can, and I hope will, commit to net zero carbon emissions. #ClimateWeekNYC 
America is ready for a new breed of politician. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm throwing my support behind Earth, the candidate who will put our planet first. #StandWithEarth #Earth2018 
Now here‚Äôs a cool candidate I can support! Get registered to vote and ready for a big announcement. #2018MidTerms #RegisterToVote 
It's increasingly clear that we must urgently step up our commitments to solving the climate crisis. I look forward to joining @wef's #wefimpact meeting next week to explore how government and business leaders are doing just that. 
‚ÄúRain bombs‚Äù fueled by the climate crisis contribute to flooding that has led to toxic coal ash flowing into a river in NC. Thinking of brave citizens I met w/my daughter @KarennaGore @RevDrBarber fighting for protections from this dangerous pollution. 
Former Congresswoman Marilyn Lloyd was a dear and loyal friend who served her district and nation with dignity and grace. She leaves behind a lasting legacy in Tennessee. I will miss her greatly. 
My friend @traecrowder considered a novel idea for convincing people to care about the climate crisis. I favor a more constructive approach. Watch his latest ‚Äúporch rant.‚Äù He has a surprise guest! 
The Trump administration justifies its rollback of methane standards by saying it will be a cost-saver for industry. But what about the costs to our health, and the costs of the climate crisis? We need to put people and our planet over polluters‚Äô profits. 
Huge thanks to @JerryBrownGov for convening this broad coalition of ministers, governors, mayors, and business leaders from around the world for #GCAS2018 to ensure that we increase our ambition and step up our commitments to the Paris Agreement. 
I commend @SenWarren for her leadership introducing the Climate Disclosure Act. Here is my statement: 
Exciting news from my good friend @GovMurphy here at #GCAS2018! New Jersey is on track to reach the critical milestone of 3,500MW of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030. Wow! It‚Äôs clear that NJ is serious about addressing the climate crisis. #StepUp2018 
Cities are on the front lines of the climate crisis. That‚Äôs why they are leading on solutions like building efficiency, zero-emission buses, and zero-waste. I'm thrilled to join @C40Cities and @Mayors4Climate at #Cities4Climate: The Future is Us today. 
China has a historic opportunity to contribute to global economic growth through low-carbon development and is demonstrating its commitment to do so at #GCAS2018. It‚Äôs bold domestic action is an incredibly important signal to the world for our need to lower emissions. #StepUp2018 
Huge win for all who have been fighting to push #SB100 across the finish line in California! Congrats to @JerryBrownGov, @kdeleon, @ClimateReality activists who made their voices heard. Great way to kick off #GCAS2018! 
Many cities are getting the job done when it comes to solving the climate crisis. I can't wait to join mayors from around the world at the #Cities4Climate: The Future is Us event to highlight city leadership on climate action. #StepUp2018 
I‚Äôm so inspired by the growing number of activists demanding action on the climate crisis. This Saturday in San Francisco, join #RiseforClimate, the largest ever climate march on the west coast for jobs justice! 
Thanks to the more than 2k new @ClimateReality Leaders who made the Mega Training in LA this week possible! I can‚Äôt wait to see the differences you make in your communities in our shared effort to solve the climate crisis! #LeadOnClimate 
Another huge win in our fight to #StopKM. Our voices are being heard. The grassroots climate movement in Canada is making a difference! 
Fascinating @ClimateReality panel with @CalFire_Chief, Martha Karsten of Big Sur Fire, and Ken Thompson from New South Wales representing the brave women and men risking their lives to manage the historic wildfires currently happening around the world. #LeadOnClimate. 
Glad I could help with this important effort to get #SB100 passed! 
Great discussion with @LCJandA‚Äôs Veronica Garibay, @LuskinCenter‚Äôs J.R. DeShazo and @SenatorPavley about the specific ways California will continue to be a leader in solving the climate crisis! #LeadOnClimate 
My statement on the passing of Senator John McCain. 
The Environmental Justice movement started in NC, where still today citizens suffer from exposure to toxic coal ash, among other threats. @RevDrBarber I visited these brave people last week. This is ‚Äúecological devastation‚Äù in a very dangerous form. 
Well-organized event last week in North Carolina hosted by Rev. William Barber II‚Äã bringing awareness to those affected by reckless coal ash storage and disposal. Thanks for having me share the stage with you, @RevDrBarber. 
The irony hypocrisy is breathtaking. Fossil fuel co's their cronies in Congress care more about protecting polluters responsible for the climate crisis than they do protecting people humanity's future. We have to change this! Register and VOTE! 
Today @EPA proposed a policy that would slow our ongoing transition to a healthier, carbon-free future. This is a failure of leadership vision. Those of us in cities, states, businesses, and NGOs will not be deterred, and will continue to build a stronger, clean energy economy. 
.@KofiAnnan dedicated his life to working for peace and to ensure that we strive to maintain the highest possible moral standards while confronting our greatest challenges collectively. My heart goes out to Nane and his entire family. 
.@ArethaFranklin was a unique thread in the fabric of our nation‚Äôs history. The Queen of Soul‚Äôs music played a vital role in uniting this country during some of our most trying times. She will be missed. 
Encouraging news from @BloombergNEF: So far in 2018, corporations have purchased 7.2GW of clean energy, already shattering 2017's global record of 5.4GW. And we've still got five months to go! 
I am praying for the Queen of Soul and her family. 
So inspired to see @RevDrBarber and @BRepairers's #MoralRevival impact here in North Carolina and @UniteThePoor's powerful efforts to give a voice to so many families who have been ignored for far too long. Join us for today's Moral Monday Mass Meeting: 
I'm near Belews Creek, NC talking with the community about the impacts of toxins from coal ash leaching into their drinking water. We must stop the burning of dirty fossil fuels and reckless dumping and irresponsible storage of its unsafe waste byproducts. 
Excited to join @RevDrBarber and my daughter @KarennaGore for this morning's worship service at Greenleaf Christian Church! 
Thanks @RevDrBarber for organizing this important tour. Looking forward to learning from communities affected by ecological injustice. 
My thoughts are with those affected by the historic wildfire in California, and the brave firefighters confronting it. Deeper droughts and longer, hotter summers ‚Äì driven by the climate crisis ‚Äì are making wildfires more common and increasingly worse. 
Cities, states, NGOs citizens are stepping up to #ActOnClimate. The proposal to weaken #cleanercar standards provides another pivotal moment to speak out fight back. Let our voices calling for a cleaner, all-electric future overwhelm the special interests. 
Some of those most affected by the climate crisis are acting to solve it. Innovations in energy storage tech., increasingly lower costs for renewable energy allow places like the island nation of Palau to transition from diesel to 100% clean energy. 
If being ‚Äúyoung and naive" is holding our leaders accountable and demanding a sustainable future, call me #YoungAndNaive. 
Young people know we must #LeadOnClimate are speaking up loudly at the Youth Climate March today. I stand with @ClimateReality Leader @Jamie_Margolin and all the leaders making @ThisIsZeroHour possible. 
So inspired by these young leaders taking to the streets this Saturday for #ThisIsZeroHour. Make your voices heard in our fight to solve the climate crisis! 
I‚Äôm looking forward to August, when I‚Äôll be in Los Angeles to train our newest class of @ClimateReality Leaders. You can apply to join us here: #LeadOnClimate 
After attending a @ClimateReality training, you‚Äôll walk away knowing more about climate science and be ready to inspire others to #LeadOnClimate. Apply now: 
The economics of clean energy continue to improve, so much that the old narrative about ‚Äúnatural gas as a bridge fuel‚Äù is almost certainly badly outdated. Great analysis from the always insightful well-researched @drvox. 
To solve the climate crisis, we must lead from the state, regional and municipal levels. California, under @JerryBrownGov‚Äôs leadership, met its 2020 goal to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels 4 years early. Now keep pushing to meet that 2030 goal! 
Excited to see all of the governors, mayors and businesses around the world joining the #ZEVChallenge to spur adoption of zero emission vehicles! #StepUp2018 #EV100 @ClimateGroup @C40cities @GCAS2018 
It‚Äôs important that editorial boards like @Guardian are connecting extreme weather to the climate crisis. Our democracies depend on media outlets informing the public with science and fact-based analyses. 
It fills me with pride and appreciation to hear what @ClimateReality Leaders have to say about our leadership trainings. I hope you can join us at our next one August 28-30 in LA #LeadOnClimate 
There are only six days left to apply for our next @ClimateReality Leadership Corps training in Los Angeles! I hope you‚Äôll join me to learn how you can #LeadOnClimate: 
Thanks to the journalists, advocates, and citizens for exposing Mr. Pruitt as a destructive, unethical, and wasteful head of the #EPA. We must remain vigilant to ensure EPA is held accountable for doing its job and addressing the climate crisis. 
Washingtonians collected enough signatures to get #YesOn1631 on the ballot to price pollution. A special congrats to our @ClimateReality Leaders for getting more than 15,500 of the signatures! Important to take the next step and vote YES in November to #LeadOnClimate. 
Montreal ambulance services have reached their limits due to health concerns from extreme heat. This heat wave makes it clear that city governments need serious policies for adapting to rising temps. If this can happen in Canada, it can happen everywhere. 
Here are seven great reasons to join me and our incredible team of experts in Los Angeles this August to become a @ClimateReality Leader: #LeadOnClimate 
Congratulations to @lopezobrador_ for his election as Mexico‚Äôs next President. Earlier this year we met to discuss his commitment to the climate crisis. Mexico can and should play a leading role in driving clean energy solutions increase its ambition under the #ParisAgreement. 
Proud of the important work the grassroots climate movement is doing in the Philippines to transition their country to a clean energy future. Big step in stopping a coal plant and new mining from going forward. 
Another ominous record has been set. The city of Quriyat, Oman, hit an overnight LOW of 108.7 degrees on Tuesday - likely the highest minimum daily temp recorded on Earth. For those suffering from the heat in the U.S. this weekend, be safe and stay cool! 
Thanks to everyone who took part in the training in Berlin this week! We need countries like Germany to meet their 2030 climate targets step up their efforts to #LeadOnClimate. Because of the work of @ClimateReality Leaders around the world, I'm confident they will. 
Under the strong leadership of @GovMurphy, New Jersey is primed to become one of America's biggest turnaround stories. All of NJ's elected officials must stand with him finally deliver on the promises they‚Äôve made, including asking millionaires to pay their fair share. 
Had a great conversation with @Patrickxander, @vixbwn, @Ischops @PaolaFiore on the origins of @ClimateReality and their personal experiences as Climate Reality Leaders. Keep up the great work as you continue to #LeadOnClimate! 
Congrats on the update to 'The Madhouse Effect‚Äô, @MichaelEMann! Can‚Äôt wait to read the new chapter. 
Leaders in the Netherlands are moving ahead with a law to cut greenhouse gas emissions 95% by 2050. This sets a new bar for urgently-needed reductions. I‚Äôm in Germany this week w/@ClimateReality trainees to encourage their government to also take strong action phase out coal. 
Powerful panel, at the Berlin @ClimateReality Leadership training, on how the climate crisis impacts human migration refugee crises around the world. Thanks @GaiaThinks Dr. Johannes Lelieveld of @maxplanckpress for being a part of this important discussion! #LeadOnClimate 
We are all feeling worsening impacts of the climate crisis, especially the most vulnerable countries. Today we have new solutions to solve the crisis. We need to align challenges with solutions at forums like @TheCVF‚Äôs #VirtualClimateSummit and urgently step up climate ambition. 
To remain a global regional leader in the transition to a sustainable future Germany must meet its 2030 emissions targets. Doing so requires phasing out coal increased political pressure. Which is why @ClimateReality is in Berlin this week training activists to #LeadOnClimate 
We're about to kick off our @ClimateReality training in Berlin where 675 leaders at all levels from around the world have come to learn how they can #LeadOnClimate! 
The German coal commission is critical to ensure the country achieves its climate targets with a #justtransition for workers. Germany should step up action or risk falling behind. Excited to be in Berlin w/ @ClimateReality to train activists to get involved. #Kohlekommission 
This August, I‚Äôm heading to Los Angeles to train our next class of activists to become @ClimateReality Leaders. Apply to be part of our largest training ever: #LeadOnClimate 
Tearing families apart and putting kids in an Archipelago of Cages is not the America that we know and love. We are at a fork in the road: one way is right; the other wrong. The President is long overdue in ending this cruel inhumane policy. 
This hits close to home. Literally. The Koch Brothers want more traffic jams so they can sell more petroleum. Then use profits to paralyze local politics and prevent solutions. Rinse and repeat. 
Good for @patagonia for giving employees the day off to vote in November. Others should follow their lead. We need to break down barriers to get more people out to vote and participate in our democracy. It‚Äôs more important now than ever. 
New, startling evidence of ice sheet melt in Antarctica that poses a grave threat to humanity. We have the tools to solve the climate crisis, we just need the will to act. Make your voice heard and get involved @ClimateReality. 
You are an inspiration to all of us, Anwar. I know you‚Äôll keep fighting for your core principles of democracy, and for a better life for the people you represent. 
The market continues to favor clean energy over fossil fuels. Solar accounted for 55% of new electricity in Q1 of 2018. This is just the latest economic sign that we can solve the climate crisis. 
Our @ClimateReality Leadership Corps takes people of all backgrounds and makes them effective leaders in solving the climate crisis. Join us for our next training this August in Los Angeles: #LeadOnClimate 
My friend @JohnDoerr knows a thing or two about setting ambitious goals and achieving them. I enjoyed learning about his thoughtful approach in his recent TED Talk. via @TEDTalks 
.@ClimateReality Leaders are developing climate solutions across the globe today. I hope you'll join our training of even more NEW Climate Leaders in LA this August! Be a part of this group of passionate committed advocates: #LeadOnClimate 
I stand with @RevDrBarber the #PoorPeoplesCampaign serving the moral cause to end ecological devastation in America. We‚Äôre fighting for the people of Flint Puerto Rico and from across the country that deserve access to clean water to live in a healthy environment. Join us! 
As the price of clean energy drops, investments in fossil fuels are risky and could be left stranded. Investors should take note of this @NatureClimate study, so we can avoid another global financial crisis. 
In the noisy and crowded media environment, it is more important than ever to find effective ways of breaking through to convey crucial messages. That's why I'm excited for my friend Joe Romm's new book 'How to Go Viral and Reach Millions'. Check it out! 
Today marks 1 year since President Trump announced plans to withdraw from the #ParisAgreement. Tomorrow marks 1 year since the rest of the world rejected this idea doubled down, American cities, states, businesses started stepping up to fill the leadership void. #StillIn 
Glad to be part of a new collection of stories about the forging of the #ParisAgreement. Check out Profiles of Paris: #BeyondParis 
Fossil fuels are subsidized 38x more than renewables globally. Now the Canadian government wants to spend billions more of taxpayer dollars to increase its country‚Äôs contribution to the climate crisis. This is not in the public interest. We must keep fighting to #StopKM. 
The climate crisis is a public health issue. It‚Äôs important that former EPA Chief Gina McCarthy will launch @HarvardCCHANGE to build a healthier more sustainable planet. Watch the #CCHANGE event w/Gina @JohnKerry tomorrow at 1pm ET! 
How can educators bring math and science to life? Through music and creativity! Great piece on @NBCNightlyNews featuring @OkGo (and my daughter Kristin‚Äôs husband, Damian Kulash) last night. Hurray OK Go! 
We must, we can, and we will solve the climate crisis. I hope you‚Äôll join @ClimateReality and me in Berlin June 26 - 28 for our next Climate Reality leadership training: #LeadOnClimate 
Washington voters should vote #Yeson1631 which puts a price on pollution and ensures the state continues to be a leader in the clean energy economy. Kudos to the broad, diverse coalition working to ensure the most impacted communities share in these benefits. 
Hurricane Harvey dumped as much rain on TX Louisiana in 5 days as the full flow of Niagara Falls over 500 days. The climate crisis is warming our waters, leading to more intense rainfall. A new study shows that seawater in the Gulf was nearly 86 degrees! 
Congratulations to the people of Malaysia and to my friends @anwaribrahim and @drwanazizah on your historic victory! Your dedication, courage, vision, and sacrifice are an inspiration to democrats around the world. 
Good for @washingtonpost, exposing this pitiful attempt to downplay the threat of the climate crisis on our military and national security. Avoidance isn‚Äôt going to make the threat go away. In fact, it only makes us more vulnerable. 
The Kinder Morgan pipeline carrying dirty tar sands oil would be a step backward in our efforts to solve the climate crisis. I stand with @jjhorgan, @MayorGregor, and all of the Canadians - including the First Nations - who are fighting to stop this destructive pipeline. #StopKM 
It‚Äôs imperative that we all do our part to protect our shared home. Join me in Berlin June 26 - 28 to become a @ClimateReality leader: #LeadOnClimate 
More than 10 million people are now employed by the renewable energy industry, according to @IRENA. Just the latest proof that the Sustainability Revolution is the greatest investment job creating opportunity in history. 
CO2 levels in our atmosphere are now the highest in recorded history, going back at least 800,000 years, according to @Scripps_Ocean. More heat-trapping pollution leads to more extreme weather, like that recent record heat in Pakistan. 
17 of the hottest years on record have been in the last 18 years. Nowhere is this more stark than in Pakistan, where one city recently reached 122.4 degrees Fahrenheit (50.2 degrees Celsius) ‚Äì a new record for April. 
This June, I‚Äôm gathering climate experts and citizen leaders in Berlin for our next @ClimateReality leadership training. Apply now: #LeadOnClimate 
The climate crisis affects us in so many ways. Here‚Äôs another - our planet is getting warmer and that‚Äôs playing a major role in the spread of diseases. 
I stand with @JerryBrownGov and the coalition of states standing up to EPA‚Äôs attempt to weaken greenhouse gas emission standards for cars. The climate crisis is too urgent to turn back. 
Congratulations to my friend @johndoerr for all of the success with his new book ‚ÄúMeasure What Matters‚Äù! 
The world is at the beginning of a seismic shift that will benefit the planet society. My new oped with David Blood explains this global Sustainability Revolution, which has the magnitude of the Industrial Revolution speed of the Digital Revolution. 
It is such an honor to be here in Montgomery, Alabama at the @MemPeaceJustice. Thank you Bryan Stevenson @eji_org for inviting me to speak about environmental justice at this important memorial. 
Thanks to @Wellesley for having me, and for the thoughtful questions! Proud of the progress you‚Äôve made through your Year of Sustainability. 
Transportation is now the top GHG emitting sector in America. Smart, creative thinking like this from @JustinHGillis @hal_harvey can reduce this pollution significantly, and help us solve the climate crisis. 
Thanks for having me, Mark, to discuss the exciting opportunity presented by the Sustainability Revolution! 
Former First Lady Barbara Bush was a pillar of strength for her family and was much admired in our country. Both the wife and the mother of a U.S. President, she will be remembered for her service, pragmatism, and strong, kind spirit. 
Thank you @officialjaden! You and other leaders in your generation ‚Äãgive me hope that we will solve the climate crisis. 
Looking forward to celebrating Earth Day this year with everyone @sachamamaorg in Miami! 
Looking forward to celebrating Earth Day this year with everyone @sachamamaorg in Miami! 
Senators should reject Mike Pompeo‚Äôs nomination to be Secretary of State. He denies the climate crisis, and has been doing the bidding for fossil fuel interests his whole career. The American people deserve better. 
Apple is proving the business case for reducing GHG emissions and simultaneously reducing energy costs. All of its facilities are now powered by 100% clean energy! 
Important piece from @JustinHGillis about the threat of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. The climate crisis is real and unequivocal. The President should fire Mr. Pruitt. 
I will greatly miss Senator Danny Akaka. Here is my statement on his passing. 
Shell proved to be prescient about violent storms resulting from the climate crisis in the 1980s. But they did nothing. We must demand better and shift to clean energy! #ShellKnew. 
Last year, climate-related and other natural disasters caused a staggering $306 billion in total damages in the US. Learn more about the climate crisis and extreme weather in @ClimateReality's free new e-book: 
My friend @johndoerr has written a new book for teams that want to accomplish big goals. I look forward to reading it! 
The carmakers are reneging on a fair deal ‚Äì in order to be bailed out by taxpayers, they agreed to strong emissions standards. Following through on this deal is critical to responding to the urgent threat of the climate crisis ensuring that carmakers compete in future markets. 
Looking forward to tuning into what should be a facinating discussion between Rev. Leo Woodbury, @RevYearwood @EJinAction! 
Proud of my daughter @KarennaGore and all 13 of the men and women who won in court, for standing up to fossil fuel interests with resolve. The Judge‚Äôs reliance on the ‚ÄúNecessity Defense‚Äù is an important precedent in our fight to solve the climate crisis. 
Thank you to #CDMX for hosting this week‚Äôs @ClimateReality Leadership training, and big thanks to everyone who came out from around the world and is now a Climate Reality Leader! Hasta pronto! #LeadOnClimate 
I am deeply saddened by the passing of my friend, Nancy McFadden. She was an extraordinary public servant whose wise counsel I relied upon for much of the last 25 years, including when she was my invaluable Deputy Chief of Staff in the White House. I will miss her deeply. 
Great questions this morning from the new Climate Reality Leader trainees here in #CDMX ‚Äì thank you to Dr. Adri√°n Fern√°ndez Bremauntz of ICM, Dr. Ana Cecilia Alvarez Conde of @UNAM_MX Dr. Henry Pollack of @UMich for your expert answers! #LeadOnClimate 
Thank you to Jorge Villarreal Padilla of ICM, @tabnrgy of @WWF_LAC Dr. Cuauht√©moc Le√≥n Diez of @cegamcsur for a thoughtful, forward-looking panel this morning on ensuring a just transition to clean energy in Mexico! #LeadOnClimate 
Getting ready to kick off this week‚Äôs @ClimateReality training here in #CDMX! #LeadOnClimate. 
Excited to announce that I just joined @Instagram! You can follow me here: 
Stephen Hawking's historic breakthroughs in science advanced humanity‚Äôs understanding of the universe even as the extraordinarily courageous life he led inspired us all. He will be greatly missed and will never be forgotten. 
We need more strong voices like that of @SenWhitehouse calling on politicians to respond to the urgent threat of the climate crisis. Today marks his 200th ‚Äúwake up call‚Äù to the Senate. Keep going Senator! 
.@NYGovCuomo is showing leadership on the climate crisis building a sustainable future in NY. Proud to support his #cleanenergy announcement today. 
Excited to be with @Kathleen_Wynne today fighting for her bold #climate agenda. We can‚Äôt go backwards in Ontario or anywhere. The climate crisis is too urgent. #onpoli 
More positive momentum. Energy storage in the US is growing rapidly and may double this year according to @GTMResearch projections. 
The number of cities powered mostly by renewable energy has more than doubled since 2015, according to @CDP, with many of them already planning to be 100% Committed by 2030! 
It‚Äôs concerning how warm the Arctic is right now, with record temps and low sea ice. As @thinkprogress says, what happens in the Arctic doesn‚Äôt stay in the Arctic. 
Rev. Billy Graham personally touched the lives, hearts souls of hundreds of millions of people with his determination to deliver the message of Jesus Christ. He was beloved by those transformed by his lifelong dedication to spreading the gospel. He will always be remembered‚Äã. 
In India (7% of global emissions), wind + solar = 64% of new electricity capacity in 2017, according to @Mercomindia: 
In the EU (10% of global emissions), wind + solar = 77% of new electricity capacity in 2017, according to @WindEurope: 
In the United States (15% of global emissions), wind + solar = 62% of new electricity capacity in 2017, according to @BCSECleanEnergy @BloombergNEF: 
In China (28% of global emissions), wind + solar = 55% of new electricity capacity in 2017, according to @rhodium_group: 
As clean renewable energy continues to grow at an unprecedented pace, the highest emitting countries are driving toward their #ParisAgreement commitments. In 2017, more than half of new electricity capacity in each of the top 4 carbon emitters came from #wind #solar. 
U.S intelligence officials are looking at the science and warning about the risks of the climate crisis. Why isn‚Äôt the Trump administration listening? 
Important #cleanenergy progress coming from Australia. Solar power could double in capacity this year as the cost to produce it continues to plummet. 
In Colorado and parts of the U.S, energy from solar and wind is now the cheapest source of power, even including the cost to construct new plants. Great piece from @hal_harvey and @JustinHGillis. 
For Europe to meet its #ParisAgreement goals build a more sustainable financial system, it should follow the final @HLEG_Sus_Fin report. It draws on the Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century project from @GenerationFndt @UNEP_FI @PRI_news. 
There is no war on American energy. America should lead on clean energy! Smart leaders are tapping into this unprecedented opportunity. Doesn‚Äôt @RealDonaldTrump know that US solar jobs are growing 17X the average job growth? #SOTU 
Great to see New Jersey back in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, under the leadership of my good friend @GovMurphy. States continue to lead in our fight to solve the climate crisis. 
I'm calling on members of @cducsubt @spdbt in Germany to phase out coal by 2030 in #GroKo talks. This is your moment to lead and help solve the climate crisis. 
I hope Germany will commit to #endcoal. The coalition treaty is a chance to follow through on its climate promise and capitalize on the benefits of a clean energy economy. #GroKo 
Proud of my friend Don Henry for being recognized with an Australia Day Honor, for his tireless conservation work with @ClimateReality. Congratulations on the AM, Don! 
I‚Äôm speaking on the #StepUp2018 panel now at #WEF18! Click here to watch: 
2017 was the 2nd hottest year on record, according to @NASAGoddard, and the warmest year without El Nino. That makes the past 4 years the warmest 4 ever recorded on Earth. 
Extreme weather and the climate crisis are still top threats to the global economy, according to @WEF‚Äôs latest Global Risks Report. #Risks18. 
Great analysis here - Energy PLUS storage from new solar and wind projects is now cheaper than energy from existing coal plants in Colorado. 
Any serious national security strategy must address the threat of the climate crisis. Take it from a former Navy admiral and NATO commander. 
All corners of the world are feeling the growing impact of the climate crisis. This is our only home, and this is our moment to act. #BeInconvenient 
More encouraging news! The cost of clean renewable energy and storage continues to plummet. 
I applaud the leadership demonstrated today by my friend @GovInslee Washington state with the announcement of a plan to reduce carbon emissions embrace the Sustainability Revolution through carbon pricing. #WeGotThis 
I am very proud that @aitruthfilm has been nominated for ‚ÄúBest Documentary‚Äù by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Here is my statement: 
Calling all climate activists: My next @ClimateReality Leadership training is in Mexico City, March 21-23, 2018! Learn how you can participate: 
According to the insurance company @MunichRe, 2017 had the most insured losses of any year on record - $135 billion - due largely to climate-related extreme weather events like the supercharged hurricanes in the Gulf Coast massive flooding in South Asia: 
It‚Äôs bitter cold in parts of the US, but climate scientist Dr. Michael Mann explains that‚Äôs exactly what we should expect from the climate crisis. 
President Trump is once again defying a majority of American citizens, states, and businesses. His offshore drilling proposal threatens our coastal communities, just to prop up a dying fossil fuel industry. 
I send my condolences to the LDS Church and to the family of its leader, Thomas Monson. 
The world‚Äôs largest polluter just launched the world‚Äôs largest carbon market. We are at a tipping point in the climate crisis. My statement here: 
Saddened about the loss of a great man and scholar, Calestous Juma. 
Total solar capacity in developing countries has more than tripled in the past three years thanks to cheaper clean energy. 
New scientific studies link the climate crisis and Hurricane Harvey‚Äôs record rainfall, which devastated south Texas and Louisiana this past summer. 
Important step forward in The Philippines today to cut carbon pollution. Very proud of Senator @loren_legarda the local @ClimateReality team for their tireless efforts to achieve this outcome. 
The recent images stories of the fires in California are alarming. If we don't solve the climate crisis, these types of disasters will be increasingly common. I stand with everyone in California affected. 
Great @drvox piece about the Trump administration‚Äôs push to prolong the inevitable decline of the coal industry. Perry should follow the excellent study by Alison Silverstein. Market forces favor increasingly cheap and clean renewable energy. 
The iconic "Blue Marble" photo was taken 45 years ago today. This image allowed us to see how beautiful and fragile our planet is, which to this day reminds us of our duty to protect it. 
Thank you, Senator @loren_legarda for joining this year‚Äôs #24HoursofReality, for your inspiring leadership and your ongoing efforts to ensure The Philippines cuts the burning of dirty coal and helps the world to solve the climate crisis!

Great meeting with Executive Secretary @PEspinosaC today here at #COP23! 
If you are in New Jersey, get out and vote tomorrow for my friend, @PhilMurphyNJ. Now more than ever, your vote matters! 
America‚Äôs leading scientists have confirmed what Mother Nature has been making plenty clear: the climate crisis is real and urgent. If the Administration won't listen if the federal gov't won‚Äôt act, states, cities, businesses, investors, citizens will. 
@BillClinton Thanks, @BillClinton. It was a privilege to serve our nation with you for those 8 yrs. Along with our team, we were able to do a lot of good for a lot of people. 
The climate crisis is already having serious negative impacts on the health of hundreds of millions of people around the world.

Congratulations to the @ussoccer_wnt! What a great game! #USWNT 
Congrats to @solarimpulse for reaching Hawaii on the first solar powered round the world flight! 
#MarriageEquality for all is a right. I applaud today's historic #SCOTUS decision. 
Congrats to @teamliveearth for their win in the #RAAM15, and for raising awareness for @LiveEarth:Road to Paris! 
This morning I had a great conversation with Sir Martin Sorrell at the @Cannes_Lions Festival. You can watch it here. http://t.co/p8gnoumMd8 
Major new @TheLancet study shows that the climate crisis is causing a "medical emergency.‚Äù http://t.co/jil4pKlg4T 
@TeamLiveEarth is currently in 1st place in the Race Across America, building momentum for @LiveEarth: Road to Paris: http://t.co/WtO9PqpEEA 
My friend and fellow climate activist @MarkRuffalo discusses the climate crisis and how you can take #ClimateAction. http://t.co/ZOLlZRVRO9 
No one should have to worry about the cost of picking up ‚Äî or even taking ‚Äî their medicine as prescribed. It‚Äôs time to demand accountability and fairness from price-gouging drug companies. 
"I keep saying to Democrats if you want an answer to what we do when we're back in power. Look out west." We spoke to @GavinNewsom about his growing role as a leader of the resistance. #VICENewsTonight 
I'll be on HBO's @vicenews tonight -- hope you'll tune in! 
We don‚Äôt value in society what we feminize ‚Äî and what we feminize is care, collaboration, and empathy. That goes to the very core of the issues we are facing in this country. 
As we welcome spring, wishing all those celebrating today a happy and healthy new year! #Nowruz 
As someone who grew up with dyslexia, this inspiring poem cuts right to the core. Learning disabilities can cause a great deal of pain and confusion at a young age ‚Äî but they can become one of our greatest strengths. Thank you for sharing, @Jb5Jane. 
Migrant families seeking asylum LEGALLY are being dumped on the side of the road or met by a door outside of a bus station. That is NOT a solution to the chaos created by this administration. It's just wrong. 
When two-thirds of those on death row are people of color and one-third have a severe mental illness, the application of justice is not equal. The disparities are profound, and that‚Äôs why we must end the death penalty. 
This administration gave tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations, ballooned our national debt, and now they‚Äôre filling the hole by gouging our social safety net. Seniors, children, families, and millions more do not deserve to be used as bargaining chips. 
If we fail to act on climate change, we will be forced to face the devastating, irreversible, and incomprehensible damage caused by it. This is not a time for cowering ‚Äî it‚Äôs a time for courage. 
This military ban is unlawful, immoral, and it‚Äôs deeply offensive to our brave transgender troops who have risked their lives for our country. Enough. 
Too often. 1 out of every 25 people on death row is innocent ‚Äî that means if we move forward executing 737 people in California, we‚Äôll have executed roughly 30 people who are innocent. 
Last week, the Senate voted 59-41 to block this president‚Äôs manufactured "national emergency." He vetoed it. The very foundation of our democracy is on the line here. 
We‚Äôve created a system that allows for innocent people to be put to death. We don't think that ‚Äî we know that. We‚Äôre putting a stop to that by halting the death penalty in California. 
‚ÄúWe are determined...to work and fight until justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.‚Äù ‚Äî Martin Luther King, Jr. 
This administration is *intentionally* manufacturing a crisis on our border by creating the conditions they are condemning. It‚Äôs a farce. It‚Äôs political theater. California will not be a part of it. 
About to go on @maddow on MSNBC ‚Äî tune in! 
We‚Äôve built a system where you‚Äôre treated better if you‚Äôre rich and guilty than if you‚Äôre poor and innocent. A race based system of tremendous injustice for people of color. The death penalty, by any measure, has been a failure. 
About to go on @TheView -- hope you‚Äôll tune in! 
Equal justice does not exist in the death penalty system. It has discriminated against people of color. Discriminated against people with a mental illness. It has wasted billions of dollars and has not kept us safer. This immoral practice must end. 
Pittsburgh, Charleston, Quebec, New Zealand ‚Äî no one should have to fear going to their place of worship. The hate that has fueled these horrific and cowardly acts MUST be called out. CA stands with New Zealand and Muslims everywhere. 
California‚Äôs death penalty wasted money, didn‚Äôt keep us safe, and discriminated against people with mental illness or people of color. It's past time for this immoral and irreversible practice to be over. 
This issue strikes at the very values that our state and our nation stand for. We cannot allow the death penalty to be a part of what defines us. That begins in California. 
The death penalty is not just a matter of ending someone's life ‚Äî it discriminates against people of color, the mentally ill, and those unable to pay for adequate legal representation. We put a stop to that yesterday in CA. 
Today, we took historic action to stop the death penalty in California. 
We can no longer allow the death penalty to be a part of what defines us. That begins today in California. 
The death penalty has been an abject failure. It discriminates based on the color of your skin or how much money you make. It‚Äôs ineffective, irreversible, and immoral. It goes against the very values that we stand for ‚Äî which is why CA is putting a stop to this failed system. 
Governor @GavinNewsom will make a major policy announcement today at 10:00am. Watch the livestream here. 
"Each year, millions suffer in silence for fear that getting help will result in their being blamed." Thank you for your voice, @katieporteroc. Everyone has a right to live free from abuse ‚Äî it‚Äôs past time the Violence Against Women Act is reauthorized. 
The. Worst. In. Recorded. History. What‚Äôs happening in CA is no accident. From devastating droughts to deadly wildfires ‚Äî it's all a consequence of climate change. The longer we avoid this hard truth, the more damage we will see. 
We need to return to our basic humanity and decency. The human cost of our failure to advance comprehensive immigration reform is too high. While the federal government turns a blind eye and leaves legal asylum seekers to fend for themselves, CA won‚Äôt. 
Budgets are statements of values. Here are the Trump administration‚Äôs: - $8.6 billion for a pointless wall that Congress already rejected - $1.5 trillion cut from Medicaid - $845 billion cut from Medicare - $25 billion cut from Social Security - $220 billion cut from SNAP 
I‚Äôll be joining @andersoncooper tonight on his show at 5pm PST on @CNN. Make sure to tune in! 
This ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù and pointless border wall are naive and wasteful. California is not going to play into the hype and the politics. 
A simple choice: An America that separates kids from their parents and dumps LEGAL asylum seekers on our streets... - or - A country that lives up to its ideals, cares for its children, and provides food, medical care, and shelter for families in need. 
This administration is moving forward with its disgraceful ban to restrict trans Americans from military service ‚Äî people who have put their lives on the line to defend our country. It‚Äôs ignorant and it‚Äôs cruel. 
From reproductive freedom to the right to education to equal representation at all levels of leadership ‚Äî more must be done to support women and girls across the globe. Let‚Äôs keep up that fight this #InternationalWomensDay! 
It‚Äôs time to put the power back in the hands of the people. The #ForThePeople Act will expand voting rights and strengthen our democracy. Now, it's on the Senate to pass this bill. 
Common sense should be enough, but in case anyone needs a study: 
I met this little girl today at a migrant shelter along our border. She wanted to show me a drawing. She was sweet and kind and innocent. This is who the Trump administration is trying to demonize. 
America has long been a shining beacon of hope. A place of refuge for those fleeing violence. A place that welcomes immigrants and sees our diversity as our strength. In the absence of federal leadership, California will carry that tradition forward. 
I‚Äôm at our border today where there is no ‚Äúnational emergency.‚Äù San Ysidro is the busiest border crossing in the Western Hemisphere. It‚Äôs a region of economic vibrancy ‚Äî of trade and commerce. Our state thrives because of the families who live on both sides of this border. 
The Trump administration has been defined by chaos and cruelty -- family separation is both. 471 parents torn apart from their children will forever be a stain on our country's history. 
Historic wins in 2018. The largest majority of women in Congress. A record number of women running for President. Despite it all, the U.S. still lags behind. This #WomensHistoryMonth, let's make a commitment to changing that. 
A person‚Äôs freedom should not be determined by their ATM balance. California must put an end to a corrupt cash bail system that targets people of color and criminalizes poverty. 
The. Census. Needs. To. Count. Every. Person. The integrity of our democracy depends on it. 
Women‚Äôs health is not a political game. This gag rule is reckless, dangerous, and unconstitutional. California is fighting back. 
It is a horrific tragedy that babies remain separated from their families because of this administration‚Äôs cruel and horrendous immigration policies. This is a humanitarian crisis. It cannot be forgotten. It must end. 
This gag rule is nothing short of an assault on women‚Äôs health. It‚Äôs dangerous. It‚Äôs irresponsible. And it‚Äôs unconstitutional. We will fight this. 
‚ÄúMedical care should be between a woman and her doctor, not the president and vice president. California is standing with women across the nation for their health and their rights.‚Äù - @AGBecerra and CA are filing suit against this dangerous Gag Rule. #NoGagRule #ProtectTitleX 
Let's be clear, what Trump is attacking is gender equality female autonomy. So in CA, we will stand up for all women. We will protect organizations like Planned Parenthood. And we will make sure that the women of this nation know that CA has their back. 
It‚Äôs up to us to renew the California Dream for a new generation. We‚Äôre investing in a future that will realize the potential of every child in CA and allow them to succeed. 
What's happening in California, and around the world, is no accident. From devastating droughts to deadly wildfires to hazardous flooding ‚Äî it's all a consequence of climate change. The longer we avoid this reality, the more damage we will see. 
‚ÄúWhen you see something that is not right, not fair, not just...say something, do something.‚Äù 
So great to be with you all!! 
More than 1,000,000 Californians rely on Title X funding for family planning and health care organizations like Planned Parenthood. This gag rule would take that away. 
You would think you would have learned by now that your fearmongering tactics don‚Äôt work in CA. 
Most skip going to the doctor because they can't afford it. Housing costs are through the roof. The American dream should be available to ALL‚Äînot just the privileged few. We must make quality, affordable health care and housing a reality. In CA, we will. 
Elections. Matter. What an incredible moment today. 
Thinking of all those impacted by this devastating flooding, and grateful for the quick response by first responders. To all those in affected areas ‚Äî please listen to local authorities‚Äô warnings and follow all evacuation orders. 
Happy birthday to our youngest, Dutch!! Can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre 3! 
If this administration does not take immediate action to tackle climate change at the federal level ‚Äî the consequences can be deadly and costly on communities everywhere. 
Common-sense gun safety legislation works. We know this because CA has led the way on gun violence prevention ‚Äî but we still need Congress to get its act together. I‚Äôm glad to see Democrats in the House moving things forward. 
Thank you, @SpeakerPelosi, for meeting yesterday! Grateful for your leadership. California is lucky to have a champion like you fighting for us in Washington. 
Border state governors standing tall (no matter our height!!) against pointless walls. 
Rural counties in California face some unique challenges when it comes to homelessness and wildfire preparedness. That's why I went to Grass Valley to meet with folks and talk to them about the issues central to their communities. 
It's long past time this political theater over a manufactured border crisis came to an end. California is not standing by as the President misuses our National Guard troops. 
This administration finalized its gag rule ‚Äî which dismantles Title X, attacks health centers like Planned Parenthood, undermines patients' rights, and dangerously restricts access to life-saving health services. We cannot let them get away with it. 
San Francisco lost a dedicated public servant last night in Jeff Adachi. He was a passionate fighter for fairness and led the charge on progressive criminal justice policy. He will be greatly missed. 
We have an administration that continues to reject the reality of climate change. We must demand immediate action on this threat from the federal government. 
The Trump Administration‚Äòs choice to push a made-up ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù and ignore the real crises that face our nation is beyond reckless. We cannot continue to reject the reality of climate change. 
This administration continues its political charade by targeting our state and cutting off negotiations on clean car standards. California will not stand idly by as the President and his allies attempt to put the health of millions at risk. 
Climate change is real. The evidence is all around us ‚Äî and the consequences of inaction are deadly. Enough. The time to act is NOW. 
Here in California, we work closely to solve big problems ‚Äî from tackling climate change to keeping families together. We're proof that government can do good work for ALL people and thrive. I see why the President doesn't like that. 
Being LGBTQ is still illegal in nearly 40% of countries in the United Nations. This headline isn‚Äôt surprising given this administration‚Äôs abysmal record on LGBTQ rights ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean we should accept this as the status quo. 
Another targeted attack on CA by the Trump administration. Clean air should be the most basic of human rights. This is a reckless political stunt that puts the health of MILLIONS of kids, families, and communities across America at risk. 
If we want a #CaliforniaForAll, we have to build housing for all. We need accountability. We need to support local governments that do what‚Äôs right, like Anaheim and Santa Rosa. 
Yesterday, I met with mayors from across California and heard the difficulties they face in tackling the housing affordability crisis and why they need support. My commitment is to provide that support. 
Expanding paid family leave will mean a better life for our kids, our workers, our economy, and our future. Here in California, we‚Äôre committed to getting this done. 
Governor @GavinNewsom and Mayor @RobertGarciaLB are touring our @CVCLongBeach and talking about housing 
The President didn‚Äôt get his way, so he‚Äôs trying to bypass Congress and use your taxpayer dollars for his pointless border wall. It‚Äôs reckless. It‚Äôs unprecedented. And California will not stand for it. 
Instead of fighting the actual threats facing Americans, the President has chosen to undermine our Constitution and fan the flames of nativism xenophobia. This is not a ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù... it‚Äôs a national disgrace. California will see you in court. 
Climate change affects the air we breathe, the water we drink, what we eat, and where we live. This is a REAL emergency. 
This ‚Äòemergency‚Äô is a national disgrace. California will stand with Congress in court as they fight the declaration. 
I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs an emergency: Separated families Gun violence Climate change Those are some real emergencies we're facing ‚Äî not a pointless border wall. 
The President didn‚Äôt get his way ‚Äî so he‚Äôs manufacturing a crisis and declaring a made-up ‚Äònational emergency‚Äô to seize power and subvert the Constitution. California will not stand for it. 
Kamala Harris is a fearless fighter. A voice for the voiceless and vulnerable. From advancing equality to defending immigrant communities to expanding opportunity, she'll do what's right. Proud to endorse @KamalaHarris for President. 
This ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù is a fabricated crisis, and CA will not stand for it. I‚Äôll be talking about President Trump‚Äôs pointless border wall at 5 pm PST on @chrislhayes. 
Tune in tonight at 8 p.m. ET. for an exclusive interview with California Governor .@GavinNewsom where he'll talk to @chrislhayes about California‚Äôs plan to sue Donald Trump over his declaration of a National Emergency #exclusive #inners 
On average, 96 people are killed every day by gun violence in America. THIS is a real emergency. 
LIVE NOW: @GavinNewsom and @AGBecerra discuss the President's national emergency declaration. 
President Trump is manufacturing a crisis and declaring a made-up ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù in order to seize power. This ‚Äúemergency‚Äù is a national disgrace -- and the blame lays solely at the feet of the President. Our message to the White House is simple: CA will see you in court. 
More than a million Californians woke up without clean drinking water this morning. Yesterday, I signed my first bill as Governor ‚Äî to provide emergency funding to help solve this crisis. These children deserve better. 
Nearly 2,000 families have lost children to gun violence since Parkland and Republicans in Congress have done nothing to prevent it. If you cannot protect the kids of this country, you should not maintain any position of influence or power. #MSDStrong 
Happy #ValentinesDay to my rock and love of my life, @JenSiebelNewsom ‚Äî could not have imagined a better soulmate and life partner than you!! 
Fake news. We‚Äôre building high-speed rail, connecting the Central Valley and beyond. This is CA‚Äôs money, allocated by Congress for this project. We‚Äôre not giving it back. The train is leaving the station ‚Äî better get on board! (Also, desperately searching for some wall $$??) 
Climate change is a global threat, and California is not waiting around for Republicans in Washington to finally get their act together to tackle it. We‚Äôre taking matters into our own hands. 
Your data has value and it belongs to you. California consumers have a right to know how their personal data is being used, but they should also be able to share in the wealth. 
Grateful to have had Allyn Pierce with us yesterday. He‚Äôs a registered nurse in Paradise who ‚Äî instead of saving himself ‚Äî drove back through the fire to treat the injured and safely evacuate everyone. This is what we do in California. 
This is so much more than a train project. It's a transformation project. Anchored by high-speed rail, we can align our economic, workforce, and transportation strategies to revitalize communities across our state. 
For those who want to walk away: Abandoning high speed rail means we will have wasted billions of dollars with nothing but broken promises and lawsuits to show for it. I'm not interested in sending $3.5B in federal funding--exclusively allocated for HSR--back to the White House. 
We're going to make high-speed rail a reality for CA. We have the capacity to complete the rail between Merced and Bakersfield. We will continue our regional projects north and south. Finish Phase 1 enviro work. Connect the Central Valley to other parts of the state. 
Taking care of each other, showing courage when it matters most ‚Äî this is what we do in California. I believe in our state. And I know this at the bottom of my heart: the best is yet to come. #CASOTS 
The problems we face are as hard as they come and decades in the making. But I truly believe we have the tools to solve them. Most importantly, we have the ingenuity and generosity of our people. #CaliforniaforAll 
The White House is laser-focused on destroying the ACA. This year‚Äôs @CoveredCA premiums increased almost twice as much as we expected. It‚Äôs exactly what we feared, and it‚Äôs exactly what they wanted. California must act where Washington has failed. 
California should never be a place where only the well-off can lead a good life ‚Äî but right now, 2/3 of our young people say they can‚Äôt afford to live here. If we want a #CaliforniaforAll, we have to build housing for all. 
The fear-mongering from the White House about the so-called ‚Äòemergency‚Äô at our border is an attack on our friends and neighbors ‚Äî and on California‚Äôs values. Our answer is this: No more division, no more xenophobia, and no more nativism. 
We‚Äôre seeing the lowest number of border crossings since 1971 and our undocumented population is at its lowest level in more than a decade. Those are the facts. The border ‚Äòemergency‚Äô is a manufactured crisis and California will not be a part of this political theater. 
Last week, we heard the president offer a vision of an America fundamentally at odds with California values during the #SOTU. Just yesterday, he went down to El Paso and said it again. We must stand up for those maligned, marginalized, and scapegoated. 
The tough calls we must make together on how we protect immigrants, tackle the housing crisis, guarantee affordable health care, and build a #CAforAll will shape the future of our state for decades to come. #CASOTS 
The State of our State is strong ‚Äî but along with that prosperity and progress, there are problems that have been deferred for too long and that threaten to put the California dream out of reach for too many. #CASOTS 
TUNE IN: @GavinNewsom delivers his first State of the State Address #CaliforniaForAll #CASOTS 
We‚Äôre live with @GavinNewsom as he discusses moving @theCAguard personnel from the border redeploying them to focus on the actual threats California faces, not the White House‚Äôs manufactured crisis. #CaliforniaForAll 
The facts: ‚Üí Immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born citizens ‚Üí Lowest number of border crossings since 1971 ‚Üí Undoc population at its lowest level in more than a decade. It‚Äôs time to stop using our National Guard as a political prop. 
Thank you, @GavinNewsom, for not playing politics with members of our National Guard. This move by the President is just political grandstanding and we cannot play into this stunt. 
Gov Gavin Newsom is doing the right thing by stopping National Guard Members from wasting their time. I previously served on active duty can confirm it is really stupid to put troops at our border because of slow caravans that present themselves at ports of entry. @GavinNewsom 
Trump's border theatrics have cost us too much already. Gov. Newsom is doing the right thing. #SecurityNotTheater 
The border ‚Äòemergency‚Äô is nothing more than a manufactured crisis ‚Äî and CA‚Äôs National Guard will not be part of this political theater. 
Too many of our students are leaving college with debt levels that would finance a home mortgage. Fighting student debt isn‚Äôt an option, it‚Äôs imperative. 
The #GOPTaxScam took care of the big banks, while everyone else is picking up the tab. Not only is it unfair ‚Äî but it‚Äôs downright shameful. 
It‚Äôs been nearly a year since the Parkland shooting and still no change in legislation on the federal level. If we cannot protect our children ‚Äî we've failed. We need common-sense gun reform NOW. 
7 in 10 Californians oppose Trump's border wall. That‚Äôs because most of us know it would be a waste of money, it wouldn‚Äôt work, and it would be nothing more than a monument of stupidity. 
I know it‚Äôs clich√© to call this budget a reflection of our values, but that‚Äôs exactly what it is. If we make a strong commitment to serving California children and families right now ‚Äî the progress we make will never be unmade. 
In one of his least surprising ‚Äî nevertheless, disgusting ‚Äî first moves, Kavanaugh has already started trying to tear apart Roe v. Wade. There's no mistaking this for what it is: a woman's right to control her own body is under attack. 
Here‚Äôs what happens when we elect politicians who aren‚Äôt beholden to the @NRA ‚Üí 
Sunday‚Äôs loss was a tough one... but a bet is a bet, @CharlieBakerMA. Great to spend some time with the folks at @loavesandfishes in Sacramento yesterday ‚Äî and hey, at least Brady‚Äôs from California! 
If Republicans in Washington took this issue seriously, they wouldn‚Äôt be going after coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. 
Climate change is an existential threat that affects our health, our food ‚Äî even our homes. The evidence is all around us, and the consequences of inaction are dangerous. We must act. Now. 
The @CFPB is supposed to protect consumers, not throw them under the bus ‚Äî so why in the world are we making it EASIER for greedy payday lenders to prey on vulnerable Americans? It‚Äôs incomprehensible. 
This is about more than a budget ‚Äî it‚Äôs about our values. The investments we make right now will move our state forward and help us deliver on the promise of the California dream. 
Here we go again. Instead of playing games with people‚Äôs healthcare, this administration should be focused on improving lives. Have no doubt ‚Äî we will fight back against these renewed efforts to sabotage coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. 
Stoking fear and spreading hatred. Manufacturing a border crisis. Disrupting the lives of millions over a pointless wall. That‚Äôs not leadership ‚Äî that‚Äôs trying to save face after breaking your promises to the American people. 
A reminder that the Trump administration has tried to enable insurance companies to deny coverage based on medical history. That means those with: - HIV - cancer - pregnancy - sleep apnea - acne - depression - anxiety ...and more. 
Paid Family Leave and access to abortion are equally important to women‚Äôs equality. Pretending to fight for one while denying the other is just more evidence that this President does not really care about women. #SOTU 
The Trump admin has manufactured a crisis on our border. They put children in cages and separated families. They demonized women seeking refuge. They vilianized children searching for a better life. A wall will not ‚Äúsave lives.‚Äù Real, comprehensive immigration reform will. #SOTU 
Sending warmest wishes to all those celebrating the Lunar New Year across California and around the world! I hope you and your loved ones have a joyous and prosperous #YearOfThePig. 
Tonight, @realDonaldTrump must present a plan to prevent another government shutdown without funding for a pointless border wall. Anything less would be another failure to the millions of Americans whose lives were disrupted by last month‚Äôs shutdown. #SOTU 
Grateful to be able to spend some time with @GabbyGiffords today, talking about how CA can lead the nation on gun violence prevention. Your courage, strength, and dedication are an inspiration to us all. 
Every Californian deserves an education that prepares them for the future. Making community college more affordable and accessible will be a big part of getting it done. 
A tragedy. Thinking of the families impacted by this devastating crash, and grateful for the quick response by emergency workers. 
Congratulations to the @Patriots and @MassGovernor on the Super Bowl victory. The @RamsNFL have an exciting young team -- they‚Äôll be back stronger next year!! 
Ready for Sean McVay and the @RamsNFL to take it home today! #SuperBowl 
To those in Southern California: stay safe, stay alert, and listen to authorities. Keeping you in our thoughts. 
The only crisis at our border is the humanitarian one caused by this administration‚Äôs cruel actions against immigrants and asylum seekers. We must be better ‚Äî and in California, we will be. 
As we celebrate the contributions of Black Americans like Mae Jemison this month, it's also important to recognize the truth: Black history is and forever will be American history. #BlackHistoryMonth 
It‚Äôs on, @MassGovernor! Confident that Sean McVay and our home state will, respectfully, leave the good people of MA crying in their chowder :) Loser wears the winning team‚Äôs jersey while performing community service hours! #SuperBowlLIII 
Every day they‚Äôre faced with the choice of compromising their health to take care of their bills. That‚Äôs just not right. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre proposing to expand health coverage to all low-income undocumented Californians up to age 26. Healthcare should be a basic human right. 
They‚Äôre scared they will get sick and not be able to afford their doctor. They will get a cavity and not be able to get a filling. They will get hurt while they are out in the fields. Or that selling bracelets on the street will not be enough to help their parents stay afloat. 
Rather than spending time with their friends... or studying for their next test, their days are consumed by the fears and anxieties of what tomorrow will look like. 
Spent my morning with some of the most inspiring young adults I‚Äôve met in a while. They work hard every day to support themselves, their families, their relatives abroad, and pay their way through school. And yes, they are undocumented. 
The longest federal shutdown in our history has had devastating consequences on workers, their families, and the integrity of our government. We cannot afford another one. 
Hundreds of thousands of families will feel the consequences from this shutdown for years to come. We can‚Äôt afford to have this happen again ‚Äî leaders in Washington need to keep the government open. 
This kind of violence should be unacceptable. We cannot continue to allow racism, homophobia, transphobia, anti-semitism, or any other form of hate continue to drive violence in our country. 
Climate. Change. Is. REAL. 
The NRA is doing everything in its power to overturn the will of the people. Californians took first-in-the-nation actions against gun violence, and we‚Äôll keep doing what it takes to keep our families and communities safe. 
10 years ago, the #LillyLedbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law. For Lilly, equal pay was ‚Äúnot just about pay. It has always been about calling out how our workplaces value women less." We still have a long way to go to get to equality, so let us ALL get back to work! 
Clean air to breathe. Clean water to drink. These should be the most basic of human rights. The Santa Barbara oil spill helped inspire a series of protections for our coasts and wildlife ‚Äî many of which the current administration is trying to eliminate. 
It‚Äôs time to offer an alternative to the corruption and incompetence of Republicans in Washington who are more interested in playing games than improving lives. Affordable, quality healthcare does not just have to be a dream. It can be a reality. 
This shutdown interrupted lives. It devastated families. Nothing would be more irresponsible than putting federal workers through another one in just a few weeks. Our government needs to stay open for business. 
It‚Äôs sick to see the @NRA‚Äôs attempts to purchase our politicians and our laws. Enough. We have a responsibility to do everything in our power to protect our children and our communities. 
Today, we remember the millions of lives taken by atrocities committed in the name of anti-Semitism and hate. Today, we recommit to never again. To never again letting hate drive our actions or failing to challenge xenophobia. We must never forget. #HolocaustMemorialDay 
With an administration like this one threatening our values and playing games with our government‚Ä¶ grateful for our champion in Washington, @SpeakerPelosi. 
This shutdown was pointless and cruel. Our country owes a great deal of gratitude to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who kept doing their jobs over the last month when Republicans in Washington wouldn't do theirs. 
Powerful forces may try to stand in our way, but California won‚Äôt back down. We‚Äôre going to build a universal healthcare system that covers every Californian and will inspire the nation. 
‚ÄúTo be told that I‚Äôm now a burden, after nearly 19 years of service, it‚Äôs really hard to understand.‚Äù This is more than cruel ‚Äî removing heroes from armed service simply because of who they are will make our country less safe. 
78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and now our government has held paychecks back from 800,000 workers ‚Äî not once, but for many, TWICE. 
It‚Äôs up to us to renew the California Dream for a new generation. We‚Äôre investing in a future that will be accessible to every California family, not just a privileged few. 
This shutdown is more than pointless ‚Äî it's dangerous. The longer it goes on, the greater the risk it poses to the health and safety of every American. 
We are committed to ending the juvenile justice system as we know it once and for all. Instead of putting kids behind bars, we should be working to prevent them from getting there in the first place. 
Outrageous. Trans Americans who have put their lives on the line to defend our country will be restricted from military service by this administration. There is no basis for this other than ignorance and cruelty. 
Martin Luther King Jr. never held office. Moral leadership doesn't require a title -- just the will to do the right thing. Each of us can help shape the future. Call out injustice. Work toward something better. #MLKDay 
In the last few months, I‚Äôve been in awe of the strength and resilience of the people of Paradise -- many of whom lost everything. We cannot afford to play politics when we should be focused on recovery. This is wrong. 
We are the only developed country in the world without a national paid family leave program. That‚Äôs unacceptable. Here in California, we‚Äôre going to lead the way. 
How many more tragic stories like these do we have to hear before Republicans in Washington finally bring the longest shutdown in history to an end? 
Yes. This shutdown has interrupted the lives of millions. It's caused hundreds of thousands to go without a paycheck. It‚Äôs created chaos and uncertainty in our economy. We cannot govern by fear, division, and scapegoating. End this shutdown. 
In CA, we are prepared to match hate with love. A zero-sum game with equality. And, finger-pointing with open hearts and arms. And together, we will create a more equitable future for ALL of our children. So thank you for having me LA! Now let‚Äôs keep marching! #WomensMarch2019 
Our mission is to provide universal healthcare to every Californian. We will not be timid. We will not back down. We will aim high and we will work like hell to get there. 
Thousands of federal workers are being put in impossible situations ‚Äî working without pay for multiple paychecks. That means missing mortgage payments for their homes, taking out more loans to send their kids to college, or worse. We can‚Äôt let this go on. 
We‚Äôre not going to back down to threats from this administration. While leaders in Washington might not be doing their job, federal workers who are vital to keeping our country running and safe are doing theirs. We‚Äôve got their backs. 
I‚Äôm at the airport meeting with TSA employees. All workers deserve the certainty of a paycheck. That‚Äôs why CA is offering unemployment insurance to those hurt by the shutdown. The people of CA should not have to suffer from Washington‚Äôs games. ‚Äî&gt; 
California Governor Gavin Newsom and I chat while Rev. Porter (NAN Sacramento President) looks on. 
There are a lot of ways to describe this government shutdown. Cruel. Pointless. Now, dangerous. We can‚Äôt let this go on. The American people shouldn‚Äôt be held hostage over politics. 
2017 was the deadliest year on record for trans Americans, and 2018 wasn‚Äôt far behind. We cannot let this happen again in 2019. 
Paid family leave isn‚Äôt a nice-to-have ‚Äî it‚Äôs a must-have. And we‚Äôre going to make it happen. 
The power of many is greater than the power of money. The cost of prescription drugs has been too high for too long. We‚Äôve had enough. It‚Äôs time to demand accountability and fair prices. 
We‚Äôre not going to play small ball on housing. No Californian should spend their whole paycheck to keep a roof over their head or live in constant fear of eviction. 
Nuemi cannot afford to live near her job. She wakes up at 4:30AM every day and drives 2 hours to work. She gets home just in time to see her 3 kids go to bed. The cost of rent and housing is too high for too many. We have to address this crisis head on. 
If you haven't gotten a chance yet, make sure to visit to sign up for your health coverage! TODAY is your LAST DAY to enroll in a 2019 plan. 
California: TOMORROW is your last chance to sign up for healthcare coverage for 2019! Spread the word. Make sure your friends and family get signed up before tomorrow‚Äôs enrollment deadline. 
The results of our work may not be evident for a long time, but that cannot be our concern. We will prepare for uncertain times ahead. We will be prudent stewards of taxpayer dollars, pay down debt, and meet our future obligations. 
This shutdown isn‚Äôt only disrupting the lives of hundreds of thousands of federal workers ‚Äî it‚Äôs also sowing chaos and uncertainty into our economy. This cannot be allowed to continue. We need our government to be open for business. 
The science is unanimous: expanding paid family leave will mean a better life for our kids, our workers, our economy, and our future. It‚Äôs not just the right thing to do ‚Äî it‚Äôs a developmental necessity. And in California, we‚Äôre committed to getting this done. 
Too many have fallen victim to this partisan bickering already -- having to worry about how to pay their rent or put food on their table. In CA, we‚Äôve got your back. 
Because of this pointless government shutdown, tens of thousands of Californians are being furloughed or forced to work without pay. 
CA is a giant engine of commerce ‚Äì the most creative in the world. But we also face a massive divide. We are both the richest and the poorest state. We have the resources to ensure a decent standard of living for all. It‚Äôs time to make it happen. 
The last major government shutdown cost us $24 billion. This shutdown is now the longest in US history. Hundreds of thousands of workers are missing their paychecks. Vital services that serve millions are frozen. The economic impact will be in the billions. This must end. 
Final stop: an elementary school where teachers, principals, and parents are struggling to bring in clean water for their students. 2nd graders who want to be doctors, zoo keepers, engineers, and pizza makers should not have to worry about anything but their limitless futures. 
It‚Äôs time to guarantee access to quality, affordable healthcare for all Californians. No one should have to worry about the cost of seeing the doctor or picking up a prescription. This is about more than policy -- it‚Äôs a moral imperative. 
It‚Äôs time to guarantee access to quality, affordable healthcare for all Californians. No one should have to worry about the cost of seeing the doctor or picking up a prescription. This is about more than policy -- it‚Äôs a moral imperative. 
Violence against LGBTQ people, especially trans women, is on the rise. Everyone should have the right to love who they love and be who they are. We cannot stand for this. 
Took my Cabinet on a surprise trip to the Central Valley to hear directly from folks who lack access to affordable, clean water. Our first stop: we met with residents who cannot drink or bathe with the water in their homes ‚Äî while paying more for it than those in Beverly Hills. 
Hundreds of thousands of fed employees will miss a paycheck today. The lives of millions of families are being needlessly interrupted. No matter how much longer this shutdown continues for, I have a message for CA‚Äôs furloughed workers: we‚Äôve got your back. 
Unconscionable -- the President of the United States is trying to take funds away from California communities devastated by natural disasters to pay for an immoral wall that America doesn‚Äôt need or want. These games need to end. 
Don‚Äôt miss your chance! Make sure to visit to sign up for your 2019 health coverage before next week‚Äôs open enrollment deadline. 
Beyond proud of @JenSiebelNewsom. Thanks to brave women like you who have demanded change, our country has seen major shifts in cultural attitudes and behaviors about gender. But it's not just women's work -- it's men's work too. It's all our work. 
Healthcare should be a basic human right. Republicans in DC are already attacking our efforts to provide quality, affordable healthcare to everyone who calls CA home. We cannot accept the status quo. We must keep demanding better care for ALL Californians. 
HONORED to have made a cameo at Dutch‚Äôs inauguration!! 
Disasters and recovery are no time for politics. I‚Äôm already taking action to modernize and manage our forests and emergency responses. The people of CA -- folks in Paradise -- should not be victims to partisan bickering. 
Mr. President -- Just yesterday, @OregonGovBrown, @GovInslee, and I sent a letter asking the federal government to work with us in taking on these unprecedented wildfires. We have been put in office by the voters to get things done, not to play games with lives. 
Pres. Trump's go-to is governing by fear and division. We can secure our border AND achieve comprehensive immigration reform--without wasting tax payer $ to build a pointless wall. Hundreds of thousands of fed workers are waiting on a paycheck. End the games. Open our government. 
Our hots are getting hotter. Dries getting drier. Wets getting wetter. Our climate is changing -- we have to change with it. When fires strike or the earth shakes, CA needs to be prepared. Today, our admin modernized the way our govt responds and prepares for natural disasters. 
I talked a lot in my speech yesterday about creating a California for All‚Äîthe idea that the California Dream should be available to all Californians‚Äînot just the privileged few. Every dream depends on the dreamers. It's up to us to renew the California Dream for a new generation. 
I am signing this letter to Congress and the WH asking that states like California be empowered to truly innovate and transform our healthcare systems: to develop a single-payer health system to achieve universal coverage, contain costs, and promote quality and affordability. 
Today, public and private purchasers of prescription drugs are left to negotiate drug prices on their own. This act will make CA the largest single purchaser of prescription drugs, and will one day allow every Californian to join with the state to negotiate drug prices. 
This executive order will allow CA to use our market power and our moral power to demand fairer prices for prescription drugs. Instead of facing price gauging drug companies alone, all Californians will take them on together. The power of many is greater than the power of money. 
California has always helped write America‚Äôs future. That‚Äôs why one of my first acts as governor is a series of bold, first in the nation actions to lower prescription drug prices and move California closer to health care for all. 
We're getting straight to work. Tune in now to watch one of my first acts as Governor -- a series of bold, first in the nation actions to lower prescription drug prices and move us closer to healthcare for all. --&gt; 
So much progress in our state has happened under the leadership of Governor Jerry Brown. It has been an honor to serve with him these past eight years ‚Äî and to learn from him, not just as his Lt Gov, but throughout my lifetime. We owe him our thanks. 
This is a time for courage -- doing what is right even when it‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs up to us what we do with it. America needs California -- the guiding light of our values and the progress we make possible. This is where America‚Äôs future is made. Let‚Äôs get to work. 
There are powerful forces arrayed against us: from powerful drug companies, to a gun lobby prioritizing profit over children's lives, to polluters who threaten our air, and payday lenders who target our most vulnerable. We have the power to stand up to them -- and we will. 
What we do today is even more consequential because of what‚Äôs happening in our country. People‚Äôs lives, freedom, security: they all hang in the balance. The country is watching us. The world is waiting on us. The future depends on it. Have no doubt: We. Will. Seize. This. Moment. 
The California dream runs deep in the history and character of our state -- but there is nothing inevitable about it. It‚Äôs up to us to renew the CA dream for a new generation. But it‚Äôs also up to us to defend it. 
What an incredible blessing to start our day with prayers for California from faith leaders all across our state. Feeling inspired and humbled. 
CA rises together. Even in the face of tragedies like the Camp Fire, Woolsey Fire and the many others CA has faced in the last few years--we lift one another up. Huge thanks to @CASenatorJim, @HenrySternCA, @ilike_mike, @SenHannahBeth and @AsmMoniqueLimon for joining us tonight! 
Wow -- INCREDIBLE to see so many folks stepping up, stepping in and helping us raise nearly $5M for victims first responders at our CA Rises concert!! Thank you @pitbull, @XAmbassadors, @BettyWho, @common, #ColdWeatherSons for helping us reach this incredible goal! #CARises 
So fun to join the @warriors and @SacramentoKings last night with the family -- what a game!! 
100 years ago, women received the right to vote. Today, over 100 women are joining the most diverse Congress in our history -- a Congress that looks more like America. Congrats, @SpeakerPelosi! Excited to see what this historic Congress will achieve. 
Today marks a new era in DC. One that‚Äôs focused on EVERY person‚Äôs ability to succeed. One that will protect women‚Äôs rights. LGBT rights. Healthcare. Clean air. Clean water. And will NOT shutdown our govt over a pointless wall. Looking forward to working w/ the @HouseDemocrats! 
$558 billion worth of goods flow across our America's southern border. BILLIONS of dollars -- MILLIONS of jobs depend on our border. The President of the United States playing games with our economy and threatening to shut down our border is irresponsible, irrational and absurd. 
Progress: This year, states across our country stepped up and passed dozens of common sense gun reforms. The @NRA was outdone and outspent by people who are sick and tired of seeing gun violence plague our nation. Your turn, Congress. 
Merry Christmas from our family to yours! Wishing everyone a season of peace, joy, compassion, and renewed dedication -- to justice, care, equality, and love. ‚ù§Ô∏è Happy Holidays! 
The last major government shutdown cost us BILLIONS. It was bad for our economy. Bad for our stability. Bad for working families. Bad for our country‚Äôs reputation. This will be the THIRD shutdown in a year. Quit playing games. End this shutdown. 
This shutdown is not something to be ‚Äúproud‚Äù of. It‚Äôs an avoidable and manufactured crisis -- based off a wall that will be nothing more than a monument of stupidity. It will disrupt hundreds of thousands of lives. It‚Äôs an embarrassment. 
Last government shutdown cost us $24B and 120,000 jobs. This is not something to play politics with. This is people‚Äôs ability to pay their mortgage. Buy their kids Christmas presents. Put food on their table. It‚Äôs 800,000 lives being thrown into chaos -- over a pointless wall. 
A step in the right direction ‚Äî but we have to do MORE. We cannot allow the @NRA to purchase our politicians laws. We have a responsibility to do everything in our power to protect our children our communities. We need comprehensive gun reform. NOW. 
This is Jakelin Ame√≠ Rosmery Caal Maquin. She was 7-years-old. She died in Border Patrol custody. We are supposed to be a land of dreams. One that cares for its children. One that protects those seeking refuge. We need an immediate investigation into how and why this happened. 
TODAY is the LAST day for open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act. CA -- you have until January 15th! Go to now. It‚Äôs not too late to get covered. 
This outrageous and misguided ruling endangers tens of millions of people‚Äôs healthcare. It puts pre-existing conditions protections at risk and the coverage of 7.3 million children and young adults in jeopardy. Have no doubt -- CA will fight back. 
Six years ago, 20 innocent children and 6 adults' lives were stolen. Today, gun violence continues to plague our nation -- from our schools, to movie theaters, to churches, to streets -- killing nearly 100 Americans every day. We cannot accept this as our reality. #SandyHook 
She was 7-years-old. She died on American soil. In custody. What is happening at our border is nothing short of a humanitarian crisis. It cannot be ignored ‚Äî and will not be solved by a wall. There must be a thorough investigation into this. 
I will forever cherish the time we had together. And while he won't be able to be there for my swearing in, I'm encouraged and proud to be taking on a job that will help continue his legacy and make this state he loved a more just, equitable place. 
He had an amazing life -- filled with love, laughter, politics, and nature. From camping along California's rivers, to this last election night, he never swayed from the lesson he taught me from a young age: it's never the wrong time to do the right thing. 
Jen and I are eternally grateful for the outpouring of love and support during this difficult time. Yesterday, my sister I lost our father, my children lost their grandpa CA lost a legend. He was a voice to the voiceless. An advocate for the environment. An inspiration to me. 
Disseminating truth. The ability to speak up and speak out. The right to fair and factual information. These are not only essential parts to our democracy ‚Äî but our freedom. Thank you. 
Our hearts break for this town. 
During my campaign we hosted over 40 town halls. We went straight to the people of CA ‚Äî asked them questions and listened to the issues that they‚Äôre facing. That doesn‚Äôt end now. Great to be back in Fresno today! 
Tonight, we remember that light can always overcome darkness. That we must always maintain hope, pursue peace, and never cease to love. Wishing a very happy Hanukkah to all those celebrating!! 
President George H.W. Bush exemplified public service through decency, civility, and honor. His legacy will live on forever. 
An amazing and productive day in Mexico City. It‚Äôs California‚Äôs responsibility to help lead the nation and build a relationship with Mexico based on compassion, justice, and prosperity. 
At the border today, I met a 3-year-old girl. She was innocent and kind, and was being housed in this shelter. She came here because someone sought a better life for her. CA is a state of refuge. A place of new beginnings. Of compassion and inclusion. We can‚Äôt forget that. 
These children are barefoot. In diapers. Choking on tear gas. Women and children who left their lives behind -- seeking peace and asylum -- were met with violence and fear. That‚Äôs not my America. We‚Äôre a land of refuge. Of hope. Of freedom. And we will not stand for this. 
The Trump admin tried to bury this report. But, the evidence of climate change is all around us -- and the consequences of inaction are deadly. Our health will be severely impacted. We‚Äôll continue to see record-breaking fires. Industries will be wiped out. We must act. Now. 
A lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. But today, I'm especially thankful for our heroic firefighters and first responders who've been working around the clock to save lives. They embody what CA means: resilient, compassionate, always willing to lift another up. Thank you. 
These communities have lost homes, schools, and loved ones ‚Äî but they have not lost their spirit. Californians stand together in times of need. And when the cameras are gone, and the news-cycle has moved on, we make sure we‚Äôre there for those that have been impacted by disaster. 
Tomorrow @GavinNewsom and I will join @POTUS during his visit to the state. Now is a time to pull together for the people of California. 
Paradise, CA. We mourn with you. We stand with you. 
We‚Äôre having to teach our children the same tactics that combat medics learn for the battlefield. 
Children are especially sensitive to smoke pollution. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself and your families from the dangers of wildfire smoke: 
CONGRATULATIONS to @katieporteroc! Katie has spent her entire career fighting for what's right -- standing up for those who need a champion and protecting consumers. I know she will do the same in DC! 
What a reminder of the resilience and compassion that embodies California. Despite the incredible damage that the #WoolseyFire has caused, first responders, firefighters, and folks who have lost nearly everything greeted me with nothing but hope, strength, and optimism. 
Thanks for welcoming me -- beyond grateful for the work you all are doing. 
Huge congrats to @joshua_harder who had the courage to stand up, raise his voice, and demand more for California. CA-10 is in great hands! 
Californians are strong. We show up for each other. If you're not in harm's way, please consider donating anything you can to those who have been affected by CA's fires: 
Spent my morning soaking in the wisdom of @JerryBrownGov. Feeling humbled, excited, and ready to get to work! 
The smoke from these wildfires can be harmful to your health ‚Äî even if you are not in a directly affected area. Make sure you are protecting yourself. 
.@JerryBrownGov on #CAFires: ‚ÄúI want to thank all the firefighters and first responders ‚Äì everyone who has worked so hard under very, very trying conditions. Our thoughts and our prayers are with those who have lost loved ones and members of their family, neighbors and friends.‚Äù 
Wildfire smoke can be caustic in your throat, and threatening to your health. Here's what to do to protect yourself. #CampFire #WoolseyFire 
CA is home to nearly 2 million veterans. Today, we thank you for your service and sacrifice ‚Äî and recommit to showing you that gratitude through our actions. It‚Äôs our turn to serve you, not just on Veterans Day, but every day we‚Äôre lucky enough to call you fellow Californians. 
Today, I stood in awe of the strength and resilience of the people of Paradise, CA. Folks who lost everything, bending down on a knee to help another up. Forever grateful for our firefighters and first responders on the frontlines tonight, battling these fires to keep CA safe. 
Some ways you can help those who have been displaced by the #CaliforniaFires: 
Lives have been lost. Entire towns have been burned to the ground. Cars abandoned on the side of the road. People are being forced to flee their homes. This is not a time for partisanship. This is a time for coordinating relief and response and lifting those in need up. 
NEW: California Secures Federal Assistance to Support Communities Impacted by #CaliforniaFires ‚û°Ô∏è 
CA mourns tonight -- for the lives lost and communities consumed by these devastating fires. If you live in or near affected areas, please stay alert. Prepare to evacuate. Listen to local authorities. 
For up-to-date information on areas affected by fires in CA, follow @CAL_FIRE and @Cal_OES. Current evacuation orders can be found here: 
Excited to announce our people-powered movement launching today: All in California. Governments should be accessible and reflect the perspectives of the people they represent. Tell us what matters to you, give us your ideas ‚Äî help us shape CA‚Äôs future! ‚û°Ô∏è 
Thinking of our firefighters today. Thank you for your courage and willingness to put your lives on the line to protect our CA communities. To all those in affected areas ‚Äî please listen to local authorities‚Äô warnings and follow all evacuation orders. 
Grateful for the opportunity to join folks at @stanthonysf today -- thank you for all you do to serve the city of SF! 
‚û°Ô∏èActing Governor @GavinNewsom Requests Presidential Emergency Declaration for Direct Federal Assistance for Wildfires: 
Grateful for the bravery of Ventura County Sheriff‚Äôs Sgt. Ron Helus, who put his life on the line to protect others. He was a true hero that will be deeply missed. 
The gun violence that continues to plague our nation is beyond heartbreaking -- it's a societal failure. Simply saying, "enough is enough," is NOT enough. We must address the root causes of these devastating acts at every level of government. 
Last night's horrific shooting in Thousand Oaks is nothing short of a tragedy. Our hearts are with all those whose loved ones were stolen from them too soon, by yet another senseless act of gun violence. 
Now is the time for going far and going together. For facts. For trust. For truth. Now is the time for leaders to lead. This is California‚Äôs moment. Incredibly honored and privileged to serve as this great state‚Äôs next Governor. 
CALIFORNIA: Don‚Äôt sit this one out. Time to get out and VOTE! Polls are open from 7AM to 8PM. Find your polling place here ‚û°Ô∏è 
Election eve. Tomorrow, we use our most powerful tool that democracy gives us ‚Äî OUR VOTE. We create change. We demand progress. We fight for what‚Äôs right. The best is yet to come. 
The stakes are too high to stay home tomorrow. It's time to move a progressive, positive agenda forward. We have the power to create change -- but only if we step up and use our voice. Time to get out and vote!! 
TOMORROW. Tomorrow we take back our country. We say no to hatred and fear-mongering. We say yes to hope and optimism. We choose to believe in our ability to build a future in which everyone is valued. Everyone has the opportunity to succeed. This is our moment. VOTE. 
An amazing rally for @katieporteroc with special guest @chelseahandler! The energy in The OC is truly amazing- as @GavinNewsom likes to say, orange is the new blue!! #BlueCA #GOTV 
Great turnout this morning for a #GOTV rally with @GavinNewsom, @KamalaHarris, @Christyfor38, and @KatieHill4CA! People are fired up and ready to vote for our values at the ballot box. Only 3 more days! 
Stop 3 for the day ‚Äî surprise drop by at the @HarleyRouda office with @KamalaHarris! He‚Äôs got some seriously amazing volunteers! 
Orange is the new blue and @katieporteroc is proof! 3 more days to elect leaders who will STAND UP to Trump and Trump-ism and STAND FOR our California values. Time to VOTE!!! 
4 DAYS. The blue wave is coming. 
.@GavinNewsom: ‚ÄúLeaders can be found anywhere...you don‚Äôt have to be something to do something...every year when we celebrate the life and times of Cesar Chavez, we‚Äôre not celebrating Governor Chavez...we all have the capacity to lead.‚Äù #TeamGavin #Vote4Equality 
.@GavinNewsom on poverty: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to do better. Millions and millions of Californians are suffering every day. We‚Äôre better than that...I know we can do so much more.‚Äù #TeamGavin #Vote4Equality 
This is our time. California's time. Not just to resist ‚Äî we will ‚Äî but to paint in bold colors. Be a positive alternative. We are the antidote to the cynicism in politics today. So let's turn out to vote to turn things around. The best is yet to come. 
"We will consider that a firearm." - The President of the United States. Talking about ROCKS -- and ordering border control to fire upon unarmed people legally seeking asylum. This is completely insane. 
Fake News Border walls Anti-Semitism School shootings ‚ÄúVery fine people‚Äù Families separated Climate change denials LGBT rights endangered Healthcare stripped away Tax cuts for billionaires corporations Our country is at stake. 5 days. Vote. 
"The Force will be with you always." - Obi-Wan Kenobi 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely incumbent upon all of us to inspire and liven young people to believe they have limitless capacity and there‚Äôs no greater place to do that than here at #UCMerced,‚Äù Lieutenant Governor @GavinNewsom said. 
It‚Äôs Halloween‚Ä¶so trick or treat. 
7 DAYS. 7 days to call. To text. To knock on doors. To VOTE. We can be bold, and big, and dream in exponential terms. We are not just the resistance ‚Äî we are the positive alternative to what‚Äôs going on in this country. So let‚Äôs get out there and have our voices heard. 
Courage for a change isn‚Äôt just about our campaign -- it‚Äôs about all of California. It‚Äôs about the blue wave that‚Äôs coming. It‚Äôs about CA‚Äôs vision and America‚Äôs values being one and the same. That's why we're hitting the road again today -- with just ONE WEEK until Election Day!

Water that‚Äôs safe to drink. Air that‚Äôs safe to breathe. Healthcare that doesn‚Äôt make you go broke. An education that prepares you for the future. These should not need to be dreams ‚Äî they should be realities. 12 days. VOTE. 
CALIFORNIA -- TODAY is the deadline to register to vote! Go to to check your registration now! Don't sit this election out -- there's too much on the line. 
"The new definition would essentially eradicate federal recognition of the estimated 1.4 million Americans." This is nothing less than the outright denial of the very existence of people -- and is just plain wrong. We cannot stand for it. 
Hello from California, @realDonaldTrump. We are not ‚Äúrioting.‚Äù We do, however, think it is a horrific tragedy that migrant children remain separated from their families because of your horrendous immigration policies. 
Happy birthday, @KamalaHarris!! Thank you for your courage and fearlessness. Here's to another year of pushing California and our nation forward! 
Clean air to breathe. Clean water to drink. These should be the most basic of human rights. Climate change isn't just about the environment, it's about the human condition. We have to take it seriously. 
P.S.- next time you bring up the gas tax, @realDonaldTrump, you should really address the 25 cent one you endorsed --&gt; 
When the guy who increased our nation‚Äôs deficit by a trillion dollars -- to line the pockets of billionaires -- tries to give you debt advice... HARD PASS. 
Mitch McConnell has summed up the election for us. A vote for the @GOP means a vote... to take away healthcare, to cut Medicare, to gut Medicaid, to slash Social Security ...all to pay for billionaire tax cuts and a deficit they have made worse. 
Definitely my better half! :) 
The @GOP believe that we should cut spending on healthcare, the poor, and the elderly so they can pay for tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and large corporations. Remember that on November 6th. 
This makes my blood boil -- there is NOTHING ‚Äúincredible‚Äù about ripping children away from their families and putting them in cages. Your policy was not only an epic failure, but an abomination. A stain on our nation‚Äôs history. We will not let you forget that, @realDonaldTrump 
@KaramoBrown Thanks for your support!! 
Almost like we saw this coming.... but remember, Mitch -- the tax cuts are supposed to pay for themselves! 
22 days. 22 days to text, to call, to canvass, to VOTE. We can‚Äôt afford to sit this one out. We have the power to shape our country‚Äôs future ‚Äî to push a positive, progressive agenda forward. 
Trump claimed last night that climate change is not man-made, is too expensive to fix, and accused scientists of having a "political agenda." This isn't ignorance -- this is the purposeful dismissal of factual evidence and science. And it's dangerous. 
Great to join my friend, @LibbySchaaf today! Oakland has such an amazing leader in her ‚Äî one who will always stand up for Oakland‚Äôs values and will stand against Trump‚Äôs attacks on our diverse communities. A huge thanks to all the volunteers who came to canvass!! 
T minus a little less than 3 hours until our new episode of @SHO_TheCircus ‚ÄîCALIFORNIA DREAMING. With @GavinNewsom @GOPLeader @JanzforCongress @DanaRohrabacher @HarleyRouda @TomSteyer and Willie Brown. With food porn from @davidchang and @TylerFlorence. 
Our education system is picking winners and losers before kindergarten. Want to know the number 1 predictor for a child ending up in the criminal justice system? How many words they speak by the age of 4. If we wait until preschool, we‚Äôre too late. 
Hey @realDonaldTrump, California has a message for you: We're not backing down. We will fight for healthcare as a human right, defend our schools against Betsy DeVos and her backwards agenda, and protect our coastlines against destructive oil drilling. See you in November. 
@PPActionCA Thank you!! 
@JenSiebelNewsom ‚ù§Ô∏è love you! 
Dear @NRA - Thanks for the upgrade! Can‚Äôt wait to receive my Fx!! 
This is a lie. The Graham-Cassidy bill YOU supported allowed for eliminating protections for pre-existing conditions, insurers to NOT cover things like pregnancy, and contained devastating cuts to Medicaid. It would have led to millions being priced out or losing coverage. 
Grateful for your courage and honesty, @JasonKander.

Angry? Frustrated? Channel that energy into helping bold, progressive, strong women fight back. @katieporteroc, @Morse4America, and @KatieHill4CA are running in 3 of the most critical House races in CA right now. Donate now to help them get elected. ‚Äî&gt; 
The Republicans may have confirmed their Justice, but they will not stop the flood of people rushing true justice and equality forward. My thoughts on Kavanaugh‚Äôs devastating confirmation - and what we can do about it - below: 
This is not the end. We can turn the tide. We can still choose hope. We can still choose decency. We can still choose truth. ...32 days until Election Day. 
Sandy Hook: 20 first graders and 6 adults killed. Aurora: 12 movie goers killed. San Bernardino: 14 people killed. Sutherland: 26 killed at a church. Parkland: 17 students and adults killed. 
My wife is a bad ass check out her new podcast!! 
Lesson #34,672 that when people like Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump talk about states rights... they actually just mean the right to control women's bodies and stop people of color from voting. 
The parade of hatred and bigotry continues. Trump‚Äôs new policy will deny same-sex partners visas unless they are married ‚Äî even if they're from countries that criminalize gay marriage. 
Hi (again), @realDonaldTrump. Heard you called me out at your rally tonight (again). Might I suggest you focus your limited attention span on, say... your Supreme Court nominee who may have committed perjury... or the hundreds of kids STILL separated from their families. Thx. 
Hundreds of migrant children are being shipped to shelters each week like pieces of cargo. They are given no notice and are told in the dead of the night so they are less likely to run. 1,600 children have been moved so far. WE. CANNOT. NORMALIZE. THIS. 
For too long our society has told us to value what's considered ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù ‚Äî dominance, aggression, power ‚Äî over traits considered ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù‚Äî empathy, care and compassion. That value system has real consequences. This week is proof. So grateful for your work, @JenSiebelNewsom! 
Our team is out today helping elect @VoteCottie to the CA Assembly! Amazing to see so many folks stepping up to turn Orange County blue elect amazing leaders. We‚Äôre texting, calling canvassing for candidates up down the state. Sign up to help! ‚û°Ô∏è 
This week has been a heavy one, but we cannot lose hope. The @GOP have demonstrated time and time again that they will always put partisanship power over morality decency. Election Day is 39 days away. Register. Vote. Bring a friend. We can ‚Äî we MUST ‚Äî be better than this. 
Dr. Ford, what you did today took so much courage. Thank you. I believe you. 
Indicted congressman Duncan Hunter is paying for ads to what should be his base - @FoxNews - to defend his embarrassing, criminal actions. So we're airing this ad on Fox News letting their anchors do the talking for us. Help keep this ad running! ‚û°Ô∏è 
606 days since the Muslim ban 406 days since Trump called white supremacists "very fine people" 172 days since his "zero tolerance" policy 78 days since Kavanaugh's nomination 42 days until Election Day. Stand up for what's right. Register. Vote. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay 
WE WILL. 
I challenge political leaders&amp;candidates to do their part to confront the devastating toll #Alzheimers takes on millions of Americans. We all need to step up. This is one issue elected officials, business &amp;citizens can rally around. #WorldAlzheimersDay 
43 days until Election Day. None of this will truly change until we step up. The @GOP have proven they are completely incapable of governing in a moral, just, or responsible manner. Register. Text. Call. Talk to friends. Talk to family. Vote. What happens next is up to us. 
Our family had fun campaigning with @GavinNewsom last weekend here in #OrangeCounty. And he's right‚Äî #OrangeisthenewBlue Let's get it done! Get involved: 
lol, hi @realDonaldTrump. ü§° Interesting description coming from the guy who is literally locking up kids like Pennywise. 
Every single one of us should be absolutely outraged by this. 
We need to begin at the beginning -- renewing our promise to our kids. A promise that says every baby will have quality prenatal care. Every toddler can attend pre-K. Every student has a high-quality after-school program. And every grad has meaningful job training and work. 
The Trump administration is diverting MILLIONS of dollars from cancer research, women‚Äôs shelters, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental, and maternal health programs to pay to INCARCERATE CHILDREN. Honestly - how do you even sleep at night, @realDonaldTrump? 
Happy 9th birthday to our oldest, Montana!! Your kindness, strength, and creativity blow us away every day. We are so proud of you! 
And that‚Äôs a wrap!! What an amazing experience traveling up and down our state to be with such incredible leaders who are helping turn CA blue! Only 51 more days to go! We can do this #BlueCA 
HB Huddle has been working tirelessly for candidates up and down the ballot. Their tenacity has been inspirational. Thank you to @HB_Huddle for organizing another fantastic event and thank you @TedLieu for your hard work in our community. #CA48 52 Days, Vote. #CA48 
Life on the trail. Cherishing these moments. #BlueCA 
CA Secretary of State @AlexPadilla4CA shares why it's important to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot: 
Inspiring stop yesterday with @RBKforAssembly- she is a true progressive champion who will fight for our kids, our environment, and our future. Lafayette‚Äî get out the vote for this amazing woman!!! #BlueCA 
Great to be with @RobertRivas_CA and @AnnaSenate in Salinas today!! Such inspiring, passionate leaders ‚Äî let‚Äôs get them elected! 
2,975 people died. It took 11 months to restore their power. Puerto Rico was a humanitarian crisis ‚Äî and you‚Äôre spending your time congratulating yourself, trashing a Mayor, and throwing paper towels at them. You are humiliating. 
In CA, we believe in science. We believe that facts matter. That it‚Äôs our duty to take care of our planet. And that our children deserve a future with clean air. Proud of our state as we continue to lead the way on climate change. 
Great to be with you! 
We couldn‚Äôt get enough of our next Gov @GavinNewsom today during his tour. Appreciate you standing with @PPActionCA candidates like @votecottie. We need the #BlueCA wave up and down the ticket for those standing up for women and PP! 
Last stop of the day, as the @GavinNewsom #BlueCA tour hits Orange County with @VoteCottie, @QuirkSilva2018, @HarleyRouda, and an amazing crew of fired up activists! 
I am so blown away by the energy in Orange County and the phenomenal women running across this state! The #bluewave is coming! #BlueCA 
Final stop for the day: an EPIC rally for @votecottie with @QuirkSilva2018. What an inspiring evening. Cottie, you really know how to throw an office opening! Orange County is going to help make this state and this country BLUE! #BlueCA 
Stop 2, Day 2: getting @UmbergFor elected to CA State Senate and @JoshLowenthal to the Assembly! #BlueCA 
We‚Äôre working with @GavinNewsom and @JoshLowenthal to turn Orange County PINK! #BlueCA #IstandwithPP 
Your next Governor, @GavinNewsom. Just like @AlForAssembly, he‚Äôll deliver for #AD66 and California! #BlueCA 
On our way and bringing some pizzas for the @AMuratsuchi team!! #BlueCA 
A day of remembrance. A day we remember those who sacrificed their lives 17 years ago. A day we remember the spirit of our democracy. The strength of our diversity. Our capacity for compassion. Our choice of hope over hate. And, as always, our courage. #September11th 
.@MomsDemand with Gun Sense candidate for California Governor @GavinNewsom today as he kicked of his bus tour: ‚ÄúThanks to all the moms here demanding action. Look out @NRA - right here‚Äôs your antidote.‚Äù 
Keep your eyes peeled for the #BlueCA bus ! 
Things I did today: 1. The first general election debate in #CA25, hosted by @LancasterCOC 2. Kicked off our future Governor @GavinNewsom's statewide bus tour with @Christyfor38 3. Grabbed dinner with dozens of local union members Things I haven't done today: 1. Taken a breath 
Today we launched our #BlueCA bus tour!! We‚Äôre so excited to hit the road, campaigning for Democrats up and down the ticket! Only 28 days until ballots drop and 57 days until Election Day! California ‚Äî make sure you VOTE! 
Shana Tova U‚Äômetukah! Wishing a sweet and happy new year to all who celebrate. May the next year bring peace and hope to us all. #RoshHashanah 
A place with millions of destinies connected by 1 dream: to be whoever you want to be. Where we celebrate diversity. We don‚Äôt regulate a woman‚Äôs body more than our assault weapons. And we invest in our kids, we don‚Äôt tear them apart from their families. Happy birthday, CA! 
Meanwhile... things Pence approves of: - conversion therapy - separating migrant children from their families - stripping away a woman‚Äôs right to choose - legalizing discrimination - labeling climate change ‚Äúa myth‚Äù - defending white supremacists 
Honored!! So great to be with you all to support @bestbuddies! 
It. Is. 2018. This. Should. Not. Need. To. Be. Written. 
America today. 
We have a rushed Supreme Court confirmation process, hundreds of thousands of withheld or missing documents, and a nominee handpicked by right-wing special interest groups who won‚Äôt even answer our questions. This isn‚Äôt a game ‚Äî Americans deserve answers. #StopKavanaugh 
Making it easier to afford healthcare. Making it harder to shoot up a school. Making folks understand that our diversity is our strength and our democracy should not be taken for granted. These are all things you can do through one single action: VOTING. 
Kavanaugh literally referred to birth control as an ‚Äúabortion-inducing drug‚Äù in his confirmation hearing yesterday. This is where we are, folks. 
Hey, @realDonaldTrump -- Next time you call me and my policies out, have the guts to @ me and we can have a chat. 
Our civil rights, voting rights, gun safety laws, and a woman‚Äôs right to choose are ALL on the line. America has a right to know Kavanaugh's record. Thank you, @CoryBooker for your courage. For demanding the transparency the American people deserve. 
The right to organize is the backbone of our economy. We wouldn‚Äôt have the minimum wage, paid sick leave, overtime, or the weekend without our unions. Thank you to all the workers who have raised their voices advocated for a better workplace a better future for CA. #LaborDay 
Heartbreaking. America has become numb to waking up to these headlines. 
Heartbreaking. America has become numb to waking up to these headlines. 
Grateful for our firefighters. 
A new low. This is not just an inconvenience. American citizens have been jailed. Unable to return to the U.S. Unable to cross the border for work. Unable to visit family. 
497 migrant children are STILL separated from their parents and remain in government custody. The Trump administration was ordered to reunite these families 36 days ago. This is a humanitarian crisis. @realDonaldTrump is hoping we forget. We will not. 
Discussing child poverty in California with Marian Wright Edelman @ChildDefender, @MRTempower, Rev. James Lawson @GavinNewsom. Sadly, our state ranks the highest in the nation for child poverty #EndChildPoverty 
So... to be clear... you think we can afford a $1.4 TRILLION tax cut for millionaires and corporations, but we cannot afford to give a public servant a 2% pay raise. 
The President of the United States calling the press the ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù is reckless and endangers our democracy ‚Äî we absolutely cannot normalize this. We have to continue calling it out. 
2,975 people died. 2,975 lives lost forever. There is absolutely nothing ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù about that. It‚Äôs a tragedy. 
What the @GOP is too scared to admit: If we don‚Äôt offer coverage to everyone - regardless of income or immigration status - we will still carry the expense. Universal access isn‚Äôt just the right thing to do - it‚Äôs the economically smart thing to do. 
Congrats, @AndrewGillum on your historic victory! From the $15 minimum wage, to Medicare for all, and common sense gun reforms ‚Äî you‚Äôve always had the courage to step up and demand more. Keep up the fight ‚Äî here‚Äôs to November! 
California is America‚Äôs coming attractions ‚Äî it‚Äôs time to lead the way to a carbon-free future. Congrats to my friends in CA State Assembly today for supporting #SB100. 
A person‚Äôs freedom should not be determined by their ATM balance. Today, California ended cash bail and opened the door to pursue a just system that does not criminalize poverty. 
Just wait till you hear about my plan for salamanders! ü¶é 
Couldn‚Äôt think of a better place to make a big announcement: Today, we launched #BlueCA ‚Äî a huge 10-week effort to help Democrats take back the House and win key races up and down the ballot in CA. Check it out!! ‚û°Ô∏è 
Make sure to check out @PodSaveAmerica‚Äôs latest tomorrow! 
On average, every day: - 47 children and teens are shot. - 7 children and teens die from gun violence. In one year: - 17,207 children and teens are shot. - 2,737 kids die from gun violence. We cannot stand idly by. We cannot elect more politicians bought by the @NRA. Vote. 
You‚Äôre a pathetic disgrace, @realDonaldTrump. 
Powerful. 
Senator John McCain is a patriot who has dedicated his life to serving his country and constantly strived to put morality and principle over party. My thoughts are with him and his family during this difficult time. 
An estimated 528 children are STILL separated from their families because of the Trump administration‚Äôs cruel and feckless immigration policies. We cannot forget about these children. 
Watch this. Trump openly admits that the definition of ‚Äúreal news‚Äù is an outlet that reports favorably of him. Everyone else he is declaring the ‚Äúenemy.‚Äù THIS IS NOT NORMAL. This is the President of the United States endangering our democracy. 
Teachers across the country cannot afford to buy basic school supplies for their classrooms. But we‚Äôre discussing buying them guns. Remember that in November. 
No one should have to choose between paying rent or buying groceries. CA‚Äôs leading the national recovery but is producing far more jobs than homes. Grateful to be in the Bayview today and for visionaries like @LondonBreed. 
This is kind of honest, compassionate, thoughtful answer is what America needs more of. Thank you, @BetoORourke. 
Trump‚Äôs plan will result in: - 1,400 premature deaths - 48,000 exacerbated asthma cases - 21,000 new missed days of school ANNUALLY. All by 2030. Actions have consequences, @realDonaldTrump. Your plan endangers public health, our air, and our planet. 
And we now go live to the White House at 11:53pm... 
As of yesterday, 539 immigrant children who were separated from their parents at the border are still in government custody. The Department of Homeland Security must immediately take action to locate every parent. #ReuniteFamiliesNow 
‚ÄúI will always be singing somewhere.‚Äù - Aretha Franklin 
A great political strategist, @AceDblDwn is first a dad, whose beloved daughter, Lili, died at 15 after struggling with a disfiguring and isolating disorder. Hear how Ace and his wife, Laura Talmus, have honored Lili‚Äôs memory w/@BeyondDiff. #AxeFiles 
Clean air. Clean water. Food to feed your family. Healthcare that doesn‚Äôt bankrupt you. An education that prepares you for the future. An affordable, safe place to call home. These should not be outlandish ideas. These should be basic human rights. 
The Trump administration is choosing to protect predatory lenders over those who have served and been willing to risk their lives for our country. Just think about that. 
Thank you to the quarter of a million Americans who spoke out against the Trump Administration‚Äôs attempt to weaponize the census and suppress immigrant communities. We won‚Äôt back down. #DefendTheCensus 
The word tragedy doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe this. 
Over 60 countries have BANNED asbestos. Thousands die from it every year. It puts workers at risk. It puts communities where the products are made at risk. It puts our environment at risk. It should not be legal, @realDonaldTrump. 
44 years ago today ‚Äî Richard Nixon‚Äôs resignation. 
First, they put families seeking asylum in cages. Now, the Trump admin wants to make it harder for LEGAL immigrants to become citizens. This proposal could affect more than 20,000,000 immigrants and punishes those seeking healthcare and food assistance. 
What a win. Together, American workers have helped build the backbone of our economy ‚Äî a strong middle class. From higher wages, to the 40-hour work week, to health and safety laws, so many have benefitted from the right to organize. This victory is just the beginning. 
Stripping away patient protections. Making care more expensive for those with pre-existing conditions. Eliminating reducing access to healthcare ‚Äî all for a political ‚Äúwin.‚Äù These are the values of the @GOP. This is what‚Äôs on the ballot in Nov. Vote. 
63 cents on the dollar. That‚Äôs how much Black women on average are paid compared to white, non-Hispanic men. That missing 37 cents on each dollar earned can add up to a devastating economic disadvantage for Black women. #BlackWomensEqualPay 
The purpose of the census is to obtain an accurate count of our country‚Äôs population. That means everyone ‚Äî our students, workers, seniors, and yes, our immigrants. TODAY is the LAST day to submit your public comment about adding a citizenship question: 
Spread the word: The Trump Administration is trying to weaponize the census in an attempt to suppress immigrant communities. Tomorrow is the last day to submit your public comment: #AllCaliforniansCount 
#CarrFire [update] northwest of Anderson (Shasta County) is now 164,413 acres and 47% contained. Evacuations and road closures in place. Unified Command: @CALFIRESHU, Redding City Fire and Whiskeytown National Park. 
53 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Johnson. I shed a little blood on that bridge in Selma and friends of mine gave their lives so that no person would be denied their right to vote. Now do your part‚Äîget registered, and vote. #goodtrouble 
Excited to be on @beHumanApp with the We Are California movement -- dedicated to lifting up our values, sharing our diverse experiences, and inspiring each other! 
Actions speak louder than words. 
Once again, we see an administration willing to ignore the facts and endanger the health of Californians and people across our country. Climate change is real. Rolling back these standards is feckless and irresponsible ‚Äî California will not stand for it. 
President Obama exemplified the kind of leadership we need. He led with courage, conviction, and compassion -- fighting for the people who most needed a champion. Now, he's endorsed our vision for CA. Humbled and grateful to have your support, @BarackObama! 
BREAKING: The Trump Administration is temporarily blocked from allowing 3D-printed guns to be distributed and downloaded online. Huge step forward to #StopDownloadableGuns. Thank you to the Attorneys General who took action. Public safety wins today. 
These guns could be untraceable. These guns could evade metal detectors. These guns could be printed in your home and be in your hand without a background check. These guns could endanger entire communities across our country. 
ATTN Californians: You have until August 7 to submit public comment about the #2020Census. You can weigh in on issues like including a citizenship question. @CASOSvote launched with a link to formally submit your comment. #AllCaliforniansCount 
Amazing! Congrats to the class! 
Now imagine that everyone has easy access to undetectable, untraceable downloadable guns. #StopDownloadableGuns 
TODAY is the last day to submit your #NoGagRule comments to @HHSGov. If you believe in protecting access to health care and that everyone should get full accurate info about their health care options, add your name now: 
We won't stop pressuring @realDonaldTrump and his administration to reunite families they forcibly separated. Every day they delay has a direct and negative impact on the families. #FamiliesBelongTogether 
Thanks for confirming you‚Äôre bought and paid for by the @NRA, but we already knew. 
Your administration approved this. What kind of incompetence and dangerous governing is this? And to check with the NRA? Holy moly. 
Amazing how proud he is to advertise that the NRA calls all the shots. Stakes are clear this November. If you want the gun lobby in charge of gun policy, vote Republican. If you want to do something about violence in America, vote em out. 
The #CarrFire has devastated so much of the Redding community and surrounding regions. Some have lost loved ones, others have lost their homes and belongings. If you'd like to support those that have been affected by the fire, you can donate here --&gt; 
For all those affected, here‚Äôs a list of evacuations in place, shelters, and road closures due to the #CarrFire. Stay safe, stay alert, and listen to authorities. Keeping you all in our thoughts. 
Thank you to the airlines that are stepping up and helping ease some of the horrific pain and tragedy these families are experiencing. 
#CarrFire Evacuation Center Listing Thank you for your cooperation and patience. Please share this information with those who may not have internet access or social media accounts. 
Thinking of the families, friends, and loved ones of the two brave firefighters who gave their lives fighting the #CarrFire, along with all those that have been affected by this tragic fire. For those in the area, please make sure to stay safe and follow all evacuation orders. 
Ten years filled with love, laughter, joy, campaigns, films, and four (!!) amazing kids. Could not have imagined a better soulmate and life partner than you. Happy 10th anniversary to my rock and love of my life, @JenSiebelNewsom! 
Today is the deadline for the Trump admin to reunite families. Read this letter from one of @SecNielsen‚Äôs employees and remember what this admin has done and the long-term effects it will have on these children. This isn‚Äôt just a tragedy ‚Äî it‚Äôs a moral crisis. And it‚Äôs not over. 
In an unsurprising but horrific move, Betsy DeVos is trying to roll back loan forgiveness rules that help defrauded students resolve debts and move on w/ their lives. This is our Dept of Education choosing to side w/ for-profit colleges over our students. 
Every citizen has the right to vote without any unnecessary barriers. That‚Äôs why ‚Äî starting in 2019 ‚Äî all vote-by-mail ballots in California will come with prepaid return postage. 
Had the honor of meeting with @staceyabrams recently! She‚Äôs the real deal ‚Äî fighting for criminal justice, affordable healthcare, women's rights, and a democracy that actually represents the people. That's what we need more of. Not bigotry and hatred posing as policy. 
A President actively, and without shame, undermining the legitimacy of our free press. This is beyond dangerous and deeply unsettling. 
Here is the Attorney General of the United States. Joining a chant and laughing about locking up a former political opponent. While speaking at a HIGH SCHOOL leadership summit. These are the values this admin is choosing to teach the next generation. 
Just your daily reminder that the White House and @SpeakerRyan are completely out of touch with reality. 
According to the @GOP, we can afford a tax cut for billionaires..... But can't afford to provide adequate healthcare for our veterans. 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?!‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù ‚ÄúOver there! Quick, look!‚Äù Thanks for the attempted distraction, but you‚Äôre not fooling us, @realDonaldTrump. 
A 10-year-old who was kept in a room with no windows and was not allowed to know the time of day. A 2-year-old kept in a "cage." A 13-year-old who shared 2 mattresses with 10 girls. Read these stories. Remember these stories. Remind people of these stores. Vote in November. 
BREAKING: NARAL Pro-Choice California endorses @GavinNewsom for California Governor. @PPActionCA @NARAL 
Reproductive freedom is the essential right of everyone to plan their futures and control their destinies. Now, the foundational principles of Roe V. Wade are at stake. Proud to have the support of @ProChoiceCA @PPact as we work to protect that freedom at every level of govt. 
Quite literally the opposite of what we saw. 
Jefferson is 6 years old. He was separated from his Dad and family for 2 months. He came back with rashes all over his body and bruising around his eye. When he finally was able to rest in his Dad's arms, he twitched and jumped in his sleep. 
with the next California Governor, @GavinNewsom. 
In which the President of a country that was built by immigrants says that immigration is "not good" for the country because it is "changing the culture." @realDonaldTrump, you are a disgrace. 
@anshelsag Thanks for coming out today! 
‚ÄúWe need leaders, and leaders can be found anywhere. Do not deny yourselves your remarkable capacity to lead. We all have capacity to do great things, as long as we step up and step in.‚Äù - @GavinNewsom #OCDems #DPOC #gavinforgovernor 
An unbelievable honor to swear in San Francisco‚Äôs first female African-American Mayor today. Congrats, @londonbreed! 
Good morning. @realDonaldTrump is slashing grants that help people obtain health insurance. 
America today: Pregnant women in detention centers are having miscarriages and are being denied care, shackled around the stomach, and abused. 
Brett Kavanaugh will do nothing but side with Trump‚Äôs dangerous, bigoted agenda. He believes assault weapons bans are unconstitutional, would dismantle the ACA, rip away a woman‚Äôs right to choose, and threaten LGBT and voting rights. He would be a disaster for our country. 
"There were so many tears in my eyes that my hands couldn't move fast enough to wipe them away...I was devastated, because I love the U.S. and was so honored to be able to serve this great country." This is disgraceful. Shame on us. 
Happy 4th of July! Today we celebrate our founding principles and values of liberty, diversity, and opportunity for all. May we be a country that believes that no matter who you are, who you love, or where you come from, you should receive every opportunity to achieve happiness. 
Happy 5th birthday to our Brooklynn! We love you so much! 
‚ÄúIf there was ever a time to resist, to organize, to mobilize -- it's now. This fight will define generations to come. Time to step up.‚Äù @GavinNewsom I am incredibly proud to have your endorsement and support. Thank you. Together we will move this country Forward. #CA48 
As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That's being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers. 
We‚Äôre sick and tired of the chaos. Of the cruelty. Of the cages. Of the concrete. We‚Äôre sick and tired of the policies of this White House. Of Zero Tolerance. Of the xenophobia. Of the hate. We‚Äòre sick and tired of Trump. We‚Äôre demanding change. #FamiliesBelongTogther 
The Trump Administration has been defined by chaos and cruelty - family separation is both. We will not sit idly by while families are torn apart and jailed for fleeing violence and seeking a better future. Time for us to step up, to move our feet and demand more of our country. 
Grateful to have shared today with our whole family to show Donald Trump that #familiesbelongtogether, not in cages. So proud of @gavinnewsom and all of YOU for showing up to say the same. 
Proud to welcome @GavinNewsom and @JenSiebelNewsom to the stage. #FamilesBelongTogetherLA 
@LauraDern @JenSiebelNewsom Great to see you - thank you for coming out today! 
Do you see what I see? An America that is not willing to let Trump‚Äôs vision win. Ready to hit the streets today with so many of you to demand that #familiesbelongtogether 
Trump has cruelly torn apart thousands of families. Now, he‚Äôs indefinitely detaining families. Time to stand up say no more. We‚Äòve seen the worst of America embodied by Donald Trump - now it‚Äôs time for the world to see the very best of America. Join us: 
America deserves to go to work, school, a concert, a place of worship, ANYWHERE, without fearing for our lives. These reporters were on the frontlines of democracy. They did not deserve to be on the frontlines of gun violence. Our hearts go out to their loved ones colleagues. 
Every major civil rights movement, from LGBT rights, to labor, to racial equality, has succeeded because of people showing up speaking up. If Trump wants to try and desecrate equality, the right to choose, the right to privacy--I'm going to make my voice heard. You should too. 
Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble. #goodtrouble 
The courts are our last line of defense. With @POTUS @SenateMajLdr shifting the balance of our courts against women's rights, workers rights, and voting rights, we're not going down without a fight. #SaveSCOTUS 
"Justice...Anthony...you know who I'm talking about." 
Couldn't agree more, @SenateMajLdr! That's why this vacancy shouldn't be filled until there is a new Congress. 
If there was ever a time to resist, to organize, to mobilize -- it's now. This fight will define generations to come. Time to step up. 
Today‚Äôs #Janus ruling is one against workers‚Äô rights. The right to organize has helped to build our strong middle class, the backbone of our economy. From the minimum wage, to safety laws, to the 40-hour work week, all workers have benefited. CA will chart its own path forward. 
In 2004, we stood up for civil rights against discrimination. 3 years ago today, the Supreme Court declared that #loveislove. We can't give in to bigotry or hate. We have a remarkable capacity to achieve great things when we step up raise our voices. 
Women have a right to accurate information about their healthcare. Self-described 'crisis pregnancy centers' should be in the business of giving women full and accurate medical information, not advancing an ideological agenda. 
Trump‚Äôs travel ban is government sponsored discrimination -- a thinly veiled attempt to target individuals based on religion and ethnicity. Monumentally disappointing that a majority on the United States Supreme Court refused to strike it down. 
Kids sleeping on mats on the concrete ground. Prison-style head counts. Parents sleeping with legs wrapped around their children in fear of them being taken. Being forced to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to a country that tore you away from your parents. 
So great to be in San Francisco today celebrating what truly makes America great. #LoveWins #pride 
Happy #pride San Francisco!! 
Tweeted less than 3 hours apart. Speaking of ‚Äúbigotry‚Äù and ‚Äúsmall plates for small minds‚Äù... 
Let us ask our Lord to help us understand that love is service, love means taking care of others. 
Amazing. 
Grateful for the support of @JohnChiangCA! Looking forward to working together to defend CA‚Äôs values and build an economy that works for every Californian. 
Trump‚Äòs policies of detaining families and separating children at our border are cruel, inhumane, and fly in the face of California's values. We want no part in these camps and your demonization of immigrants. 
‚ÄúI remembered how my family had to register. The way these kids are being treated like criminals just for existing, the fact that they‚Äôre not being told how long this will last ‚Äî it‚Äôs a very, very similar and horrific situation.‚Äù 
"Like it or not, these are not our kids. Show them compassion, but it's not like he's doing this to the people of Idaho or Texas." WE'RE LITERALLY PUTTING CHILDREN IN CAGES. 
Today‚Äôs America: A 6-year old Guatemalan girl is ripped away from her father after he sought asylum and a better life. She just celebrated her birthday alone and cries so hard she vomits. 
Trump has no plans to reunite the 2,300 children with their parents. Trump has no plans to reunite the 2,300 children with their parents. Trump has no plans to reunite the 2,300 children with their parents. Trump has no plans to reunite the 2,300 children with their parents... 
Trump‚Äôs Executive Order does not address: - How these 2,000+ children will be reunited with their parents. - His plan to create new detention facilities for FAMILIES. Separating kids is sick ‚Äî but so is imprisoning families indefinitely. 
Rachel's reaction was similar to mine. This is nearly unbearable to even process. Toddlers are being detained. Kids that have been forcibly torn away from their parents are being put in "Tender Age" shelters, described as "play rooms of crying preschool-age children in crisis." 
In recognizing Juneteenth, we must also recognize the tremendous work remaining to end institutionalized racism in America. From the border to the ballot box, sinister forces are attempting to roll back progress. Thank you to everyone on the front lines of these fights. 
Many of you have asked how you can help the families being impacted by our government's human rights abuses along the border. Here‚Äôs what you can do right now: make a donation to groups providing support to meet the most urgent needs of these families. 
.@antonio4ca has been a champion for working families across LA and our state. Grateful for his support and looking forward to working with him to make sure CA can continue to lead the nation forward. 
Happy Birthday to my rock and the love of my life, @JenSiebelNewsom. Montana, Hunter, Brooklynn, Dutch, and I are so lucky to have you in our lives. Thank you for being our constant source of strength, compassion, and kindness. We love you so much! 
Trump tried to use DREAMers as bargaining chips. That didn't work. Now he's threatening a shutdown and using children ‚Äî toddlers, 8 month old babies ‚Äî as bargaining chips to get funding for a useless wall he claimed Mexico would pay for. It‚Äôs sick. 
‚ÄúInfest‚Äù...‚Äùanimals‚Äù...the President continues to choose words that dehumanize immigrants. 
This makes me sick to my stomach. Children separated from their parents, crying out for help. Border Patrol joking that they "have an orchestra. What‚Äôs missing is a conductor.‚Äù 
Disgusting that @TheRealJohnHCox is defending Trump and his horrifically inhumane immigration policies. California deserves better. 
Sometimes truth transcends party. 
Feeling so loved and so lucky to have these 4 little ones in my life. Happy #FathersDay to all the dads out there! 
If we continue at this rate, the United States will have torn well over 10,000 children from their parents in a year. 
These kids are given under 40 square feet of living space each. They have bar codes. They scan the bar codes to eat. 
Running into friends @GavinNewsom and The Honorable Willie Brown, and many more courageous leaders, fighters, advocates, survivors at the @GiffordsCourage 25th Annual Anniversary Dinner. 
There are 2 dominant places in American history when Romans 13 has been used: - To oppose the American Revolution - In defense of slavery and to ward off abolitionists 
Unthinkable. But it‚Äôs real - and we cannot look away. 
For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in. ‚Äî Matthew 25:35 
There are moments in history where we look back and say what would I have done to stop such an atrocity from occurring? This is one of those moments. We cannot become numb to this. We cannot turn away. We cannot let this administration get away with this. 
And the mural reads: ‚ÄúSometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.‚Äù Honestly HORRIFYING. 
Congratulations to San Francisco‚Äôs newest Mayor, @LondonBreed! 
A moment I will never forget. Humbled and so proud to announce the support of one of my mentors, heroes, and role models @JerryBrownGov! 
Joining @JerryBrownGov, @Rendon63rd, the legendary John Burton and many other @CA_Dem friends in supporting the next governor of CA‚Äî@GavinNewsom! Heading into November strong! 
2 years ago, 49 people were killed at the #Pulse nightclub. It was the deadliest mass shooting in US history. We said it was a tragedy. We said never again. 2 years later, we‚Äôve experienced even deadlier shootings. Been heartbroken countless times. Still, the @GOP has not acted. 
Congrats to the @warriors!! 
An American President celebrates the disenfranchisement of eligible voters. UnAmerican. 
So lucky to have @JenSiebelNewsom as our keynote and to join us at the Capitol to experience @tiwiflproject. Thank you! #equityjusticeaction 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs good for women is good for men, too.‚Äù Thrilled to be with @PPact today talking about how to get men more involved in the conversation. #istandwithPP 
Sessions just unilaterally barred some of the world's most vulnerable -- victims of domestic violence and gang violence -- from qualifying for asylum. This is plain cruel. We should be ashamed. 
The Trump admin would like to allow insurance companies to deny you coverage based on your medical history. That means those with: - HIV - an eating disorder - cancer - pregnancy - sleep apnea - acne - depression - anxiety ...and more, could be denied. 
Goodnight, #DubNation 
3 in 4 years. History in the making. Congrats @warriors!! #DubNation 
Grateful for your support. Looking forward to working together to ensure CA keeps moving in the right direction: forward. 
If we cannot care for our children, we have failed. 
Today is a good day to take a deeper look at how our society views mental health, and to offer support to others. Brain health is just as important as physical health. We must care for one another in every way we can. 
Kindergarteners are learning rhymes to remember what to do if there is a shooting at their school. This is the reality our kids, parents, and teachers are faced with today. 
This administration has chosen to criminalize diversity. It doesn't have to be this way. We should be a country where we celebrate diversity. Where we invest in children ‚Äì we don‚Äôt tear them from the loving arms of their moms and dads. 
Please come campaign for him as much as possible. 
To me, ‚ÄúCourage for a Change‚Äù is more than a campaign slogan. It has always been -- and will always be -- California‚Äôs truest calling. Thanks to you, tonight we are one step closer to achieving it. Thank you, California. Now, on to November! 
I voted for @GavinNewsom because he'll pick up where Governor Brown left off and fight back against the Administration's attacks on our state and our values. Make sure you vote in today's primary! 
Today has been one for the books. Voting with my kids for an election we‚Äôve all worked so hard to get to is something I‚Äôll never forget. We are forever indebted to each and every one of our supporters. Thank you for everything. CA, polls close at 8pm -- make sure to vote! 
So much fun voting for @GavinNewsom!! Today is the day! We got this California!!! #TeamGavin 
That moment inspired so many across the country and moved the marriage equality movement forward in a huge way. 15 years later as Mayor of my own city - it‚Äôs exciting to support and vote for Gavin for Governor. Looking forward to celebrating his, and our, win tonight. 
CALIFORNIA! TODAY is Election Day! If you need to find your polling place visit: Your vote is your tool to create change, so make sure to use it! 
It‚Äôs closing time! Joined @GavinNewsom in final hours of campaign on his tour across CA. Gavin will bring new energy ideas to Sacramento for CA to lift families. #TeamGavin 
We are SO beyond grateful to all of our volunteers who have made the campaign possible. Thank you for believing in us - we believe in YOU and all we can do together for California!! Let's do this tomorrow!! #TeamGavin 
Earlier today, I was with this great team of volunteers supporting @GavinNewsom for Governor. We're making sure that everyone remembers to vote tomorrow in the primary. Make sure you get out and vote! #TeamGavin 
Nothing like spending the night before the election with a bunch of amazing, dedicated volunteers doing some GOTV texting (and, of course eating pizza)! Thanks to @RepSwalwell for joining us tonight! 
FaceTiming the kids on the bus -- can‚Äôt wait to see them tonight!! 
Quick stop for breakfast this morning with @mridleythomas! The waffles were 
Oh what a night!! Feeling the energy for @GavinNewsom one day out ‚Äî tomorrow we vote!! #TeamGavin 
What connects every one of us is the desire to love and be loved. For a business to deny you something as simple as a cake because you love someone of the same sex is wrong. This is a move backwards, and a move toward discrimination, hatred, inequality. 
Surreal. Final GOTV rally in LA before the Primary! Only 2 more days! A very special thank you to @JaniceHahn, @mridleythomas, @HildaSolis, @AlexPadilla4CA -- and of course, @LanceBass for coming out! Vote, vote, vote! 
Not sure who this person is but always love to hear from a fan! 
Here @GavinNewsom GOTV Rally with @JaniceHahn @HildaSolis all pushing for a strong showing on Tuesday. Shout out #TeamGavin for taking nothing for granted. @AfAmVoterREP #WokeVote18 
A very important member of #TeamGavin Mrs. Bessie Anderson at age 98 here at the @GavinNewsom GOTV Rally. If she can do it, what‚Äôs your excuse? If you don‚Äôt vote on Tuesday‚Äôs June 5th, don‚Äôt complain on Wednesday, June 6th! @CatherineASamu2 @HildaSolis @JaniceHahn @AfAmVoterREP 
Hey California, Tuesday is Election Day! It may sound crazy but it ain‚Äôt no lie! (Don‚Äôt forget to vote!) Baby #ByeByeBye So fun running into @NSYNC legend @LanceBass at tonight‚Äôs @GavinNewsom event. 
It was great to join my friend @GavinNewsom for a GOTV rally in Hollywood this evening! Election day is this Tuesday ‚Äì make your plan to vote! #GavinForGovernor 
Beyond honored to have your support. Thankful for all you‚Äôve done for LA and our state! Looking forward to working together to help solve these issues and create a just and equitable CA that works for everyone. 
GOTV with @AfAmVoterREP @SEIU2015 @JenSiebelNewsom @LaphonzaB @GavinNewsom 
‚ÄúHurry up please and vote for my dad @GavinNewsom!‚Äù 
Spirit filled service with @JosephCRobinson and @GavinNewsom and the people of 
Negotiating serious policy changes like if he gets a second helping of ice cream. 
No bus tour is complete without ice cream. 
It‚Äôs always great to be out on the campaign trail - even more fun when the whole family comes along! Thanks for an amazing afternoon, Davis! 
Having so much fun! Newsom‚Äôs are on the bus and headed to Davis. Not sure if these kiddos are ever going to want to leave! :) 
#FBF ‚û°Ô∏è 1 year ago @realDonaldTrump announced America‚Äôs withdrawal from the #ParisAgreement. Since then, California ‚Äî and the world ‚Äî have responded. We're not waiting. #ClimateAction 
Our government failed the people of Puerto Rico. And now, it‚Äôs hurricane season and 11,000 still don‚Äôt have power. This is a moral outrage and a stain on our history. The people of Puerto Rico deserve better. 
Mayor Tubbs has been a fierce advocate for the people of Stockton, reinventing it into a community of opportunity for everyone. Beyond grateful to have the support of such an inspirational leader. Thanks again for hosting us yesterday in your city, @MichaelDTubbs!! 
LISTEN @GavinNewsom What's The Tee w/@michellevisage 
Our state and country have been plagued by gun violence for far too long. Beyond proud to have the support of @MomsDemand. The NRA‚Äôs reign over our country and our laws must end. We‚Äôve had enough. #WearOrange 
Grateful for your support and looking forward to working with you to increase opportunities across the Valley! 
Thanks for coming out, Fresno! Inspired and motivated by the next generation. These kids will change the world. 
So glad @AlexPadilla4CA could join us on the road today! 
Thanks to those who joined us in Bakersfield today! CA is at once the richest and poorest state. 8 million Californians are below the poverty line. We need to focus on building an upward economy that works for every Californian - one that is measured by growth AND inclusion. 
When you run into each other on the road.... 
Vote on June 5th - @GavinNewsom for California Governor 
Vote on June 5th - @GavinNewsom for California Governor 
Final stop of the bus tour today: getting a shave with @mridleythomas at his local barbershop! 
Packed house at our Palm Springs townhall! Thank you to everyone who came to say hi and ask thoughtful questions about the issues facing CA. On to our next stop: LA! 
That‚Äôs a wrap! Thank you, Palm Springs, for joining us to #GOTV for our friend @GavinNewsom #TeamGavin Ô∏è‚Äç 
.@GavinNewsom in #PalmSprings: This coming January, California will be the first state in the nation to require the exact same background checks on ammunition as guns...and we‚Äôre going to continue to lead. #gunsafety #gunsense 
...fun? These families lost their children to a tragic shooting and you have done nothing to prevent another from occurring. You should be mournful, ashamed, and embarrassed. These families deserve better. 
Donna and Mary Anne are sisters and had not seen each other in 10 years!! They were reunited yesterday at the Serving Seniors West Wellness Center that I visited today. From dental care, to healthy meals, to reuniting families ‚Äî these folks are doing amazing work for San Diego! 
Gavin Newsom has the courage to fight back against the Administration‚Äôs attacks on our state and our values. He‚Äôll pick up where Governor Brown left off and always have our back. That‚Äôs why I was proud to campaign with him yesterday. Make sure you vote on Tuesday! 
He is a good eater. I will tell you that. 
CANP endorses @GavinNewsom for Governor. He is a leader who will shake up our health system to the benefit of providers and patients. We look forward to working with him to ensure that NPs can work to the full extent of their education and training. #CANPsLead 
Couldn‚Äôt be more proud to have these 3 amazing leaders by my side in this race for Governor. Only 6 more days to go! California -- remember to VOTE on June 5th! 
Joined @BobWeiss91362 this morning, just blocks away from where his daughter was tragically killed in the 2014 Isla Vista shooting. His courage is an inspiration. Thank you for sharing your story and demanding an end to gun violence. Veronika was so lucky to have you as a Dad. 
Can confirm. 
We are live in Isla Vista with Bob Weiss, whose daughter Veronika, was tragically killed in the shooting in IV 4 years ago. We cannot continue to do nothing while our children are dying from gun violence. It is past time for comprehensive gun control. 
Thank you San Luis Obispo for your support!! #TeamGavin 
Grateful for the support of @SierraClubCA who joined us today in Monterey! More important than ever we fight for a better future and planet for generations to come. 
And we‚Äôre off!! Headed up and down the state for a week of town halls and meetings with community leaders and voters! Keep your eyes peeled for our bus and make sure to say hi if you see us on the road! 
LET‚ÄôS. GO. #DubNation 
California is already great. We have stood tall against the hate-filled, ignorant agenda that you and @TheRealJohnHCox have pushed -- and we will do so again on June 5th. 
Today we memorialize those who sacrificed their lives for our country. We honor their love for America by showing the world why they loved it in the first place. The spirit of our democracy. The strength of our diversity. Our capacity for compassion. And, as always, our courage. 
Best part of my day will always be this :) 
spent time this afternoon talking about criminal justice reform with some folks who are going to make a real difference in CA. @SusanBurtonLA @ANewWayofLife1 @GavinNewsom @mridleythomas 
Here are the facts on the Dreamer crisis: ‚û° Trump ended DACA. ‚û° The Administration sabotaged any effort to solve that crisis. ‚û° They don‚Äôt want a deal to protect the Dreamers. They want red meat for their base. 
Eating falafel and trying out some of the local spots in Long Beach with @RobertGarciaLB!! 
@JustinCentric ü§îü§î thanks for your support! 
Yes, he is a hero. But all I can think about is how much we‚Äôre asking of our teachers because of YOUR failure to act. Our teachers are being forced to risk their lives because the spineless @GOP are too busy pandering to the NRA. #GunSenseNow 
In the words of @RuPaul... you better vote! California's primary is June 5th! Make sure your voice is heard. Oh and...Miss Vaaanjie.... 
Great to be in San Bernardino County getting out the vote and talking with community leaders about the issues facing California. Make sure to VOTE on June 5th!! 
CA is home to nearly 2 million veterans ‚Äî more than any other state in the country. Simply thanking our vets with words and parades this weekend is not enough. Here‚Äôs my vision for how CA can better serve our veterans: 
We have become numb to this. 
Proud to stand with @PPact today. Because let's get clear, this gag rule isn't really about abortion. Institutions that serve women are Donald Trump‚Äôs favorite political punching bag -- What he‚Äôs really attacking is female empowerment, autonomy, and ascension. #NoGagRule 
Children shouldn‚Äôt have to be this kind of hero. We are failing them. 
Trump's war on women continues as he threatens access to abortion, birth control, STD screenings, and more. Dismantling Title X will force healthcare providers to withhold information and destabilize clinics across our country. #IStandWithPP @PPActionCA 
Harvey Milk would have been 88 today. His courage and message of persistence and hope continue to inspire me. May we honor his legacy by raising our voices and continuing to demand true equality for all. #HarveyMilkDay 
California! The deadline to register to vote is TODAY! Make sure you're registered ‚û°Ô∏è 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the front lines of a war,‚Äù said Emily Rubinstein, a sophomore at a New York high school. ‚ÄúBeing seated in front of the classroom could be what makes you live and what makes you die.‚Äù This is the reality we have created for our children. 
My opponent, @TheRealJohnHCox has been endorsed by his hero, Donald Trump. More important than ever that CA stands up for our values and stands against Trump, his prot√©g√©, and their attempts to drag our state backwards. Find out where and how to vote at: 
No surprise you‚Äôre endorsing a candidate in your own image: one who attacks immigrants while opposing common sense gun laws and equal rights. Time time again, the people of California have rejected your brand of hate. The people of California will reject @TheRealJohnHCox too. 
Updated @GOP talking point: guns don't kill people, doors kill people. 
Here's what Ted Cruz was doing exactly two weeks ago. 
Ken Paxton was endorsed by the @NRA and received an A rating from them when he first ran in 2014. 
‚ÄúWas there a part of you that was like, this isn't real, this could not happen at my school?‚Äù Santa Fe Student: ‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs been happening everywhere. I‚Äôve always felt like it would eventually happen here, too.‚Äù This has become the new normal in America. 
In 2018, there have been 22 school shootings where someone was hurt or killed. That's more than 1 shooting a week. My heart aches for Santa Fe, but to say today is simply a tragedy isn't enough. If we cannot protect our children we've failed. We need commonsense gun reform. NOW. 
Our daughters should grow up knowing their work is worth just as much as our sons. It‚Äôs time to end this fundamental unfairness. It‚Äôs time to make equal pay a reality for all Americans. 
The gender wealth gap is even worse than the wage gap- and perhaps even more critical to address. ‚ÄúWealth is the ability to pay for an emergency or...the freedom to buy a home or pursue higher education...In short, wealth offers stability and opportunity.‚Äù 
One of our greatest tools for change is our vote. Don't take that for granted. CA's deadline to register to vote is May 21st! Make sure your voice is heard this June 5th. 
A reminder that Trump also referred to: - Mexicans as ‚Äúdrug dealers" and "rapists‚Äù - Haitians as having AIDS - Central American and African countries as ‚Äúsh*t-holes‚Äù - Nigerians as living in huts So no, I'm not trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. 
Proud to endorse @GavinNewsom to be California‚Äôs next Governor! 
Yeah.... all those Presidents that ended slavery, civil wars, depressions, and segregation were TOTALLY useless. ü§î 
Grateful for the support of @mridleythomas, a powerhouse who has worked tirelessly for the communities of Los Angeles and across our state. 
Today the President of the United States referred to immigrants as "animals." Intentionally dehumanizing an entire group of people is something that slave owners and nazis did. It's the kind of hateful rhetoric that leads to hate crimes and genocides. 
Cute meeting @realDonaldTrump, cherry picking a few right-wing electeds from a state of 39 million people. Since your team clearly didn‚Äôt brief you, here are the facts. Sanctuary counties have: -Fewer crimes -Higher median household incomes -Lower poverty -Lower unemployment 
Great to be in San Diego today hosting our 31st town hall of the campaign! 
Yes -- proposing cuts to programs that help feed veterans, children, women, and seniors must be quite exhausting. 
So grateful and honored to have your support, @SupJaniceHahn! 
Betsy DeVos hires an official from a for-profit college to head up the investigations of for-profit colleges, the team is dismantled and the investigations are "effectively killed." Almost like we saw this one coming. 
Touring Rio Hondo College today with @HildaSolis. We believe (@GavinNewsom included!) that community colleges are the backbone of our economy and one of our most effective tools for upward mobility‚Äî and Rio Hondo is proof of that. Thank you for having us! 
@kristen_valeri @NRA Ha! Thank you! 
@TyMurphy19 @shannonrwatts @NRA Thank you! 
Hi @NRA - Received your questionnaire. Not sure what gave you the impression I would ever WANT your endorsement. Or your money. Look forward to the day you're swept into the compost bin of history. Until then, receiving my F is an honor. XoXo, Your California snowflake 
My everything! Happy Mom‚Äôs Day to our real life Wonder Woman, @JenSiebelNewsom, who manages to run a nonprofit, direct and produce documentaries, and campaign with me on the trail, all while attending parent teacher conferences, ballet concerts and baseball games! We ‚ù§Ô∏è you! 
Thinking about my mom today who passed away from breast cancer. I see so much of her in my kids. That's because of their mom, too. @JenSiebelNewsom truly does it all. The kindest person I know, but also never afraid to speak her mind. :) Thankful for you and all you do!!‚ù§Ô∏è 
Women in CA still make on average 88 cents for every $1 men make. The averages for women of color are even worse. This is wrong. Talking about the wage gap and how CA can achieve equal pay with my wife @JenSiebelNewsom, @LuzRivas and @LaphonzaB! WATCH: 
Great to be in LA today with our labor leaders and grassroots activists talking about how we can continue to move CA forward!! 
CHIP covers 9 million children. Trump and the @GOP are willing to hand over tax cuts to billionaires but won't care for our children. Says everything you need to know about their values. 
Appalling and heartbreaking to see schools fanning the flames of bigotry and hate. A public school cannot punish students for being LGBT. 
Google and Facebook have banned the bail-bond industry from advertising on their pages. Continue to be astonished that we maintain a system that allows these predatory lenders to thrive and attach a price tag to freedom. Cash bail is corrupt, immoral, and must end. 
Love them!! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Rather than focusing on funding children‚Äôs health programs or programs that feed low-income communities, the @GOP is focused on.... putting up pics of Trump at post offices. 
Happy #DayOfTheTeacher! Huge THANK YOU to all the teachers out there who are not only making a difference in the classroom, but in our communities and across our state. A special shout out to my high school Italian teacher who taught me how to enjoy love learning! @WeAreCTA 
The President is claiming all negative news coverage is fake and threatening credentials of reporters. A free and independent press is one of the most essential pillars of our democracy. When you threaten it, you threaten the integrity of our government. THIS. IS. NOT. NORMAL. 
Trump and the @GOP are proposing to end or cut SNAP. Millions of Americans lack the resources to afford food, but @GOP doesn't care. Instead, they're proposing to end or cut programs that help feed: - Children - Veterans - Women - Seniors Shame on you. 
@ChildMindDotOrg Very honored, thank you again! 
If we cannot care for our children we have failed as a society. This is disgraceful. 
What an honor to be joined by @HildaSolis and these fabulous women to talk about the importance of women, community, and working together to solve our states biggest challenges‚Äî and of course, why we need @GavinNewsom to be our next governor!! 
What an honor to be on a panel with these fabulous women! Thank you #usow2018 and @ZerlinaMaxwell for moderating! 
What a treat to be at #USOW2018 with such powerhouse women‚Äî just saw the fabulous @KamalaHarris and feeling so inspired by her leadership and this community of women! 
Getting to listen to these young activists from Chicago and #MSDStrong has been my highlight of #USO2018 so far. Their leadership is transforming our nation- they give me such hope for the future. 
You know what else is a ‚Äúgift from our creator?‚Äù LIFE. Yet you‚Äôre willing to ignore the 96 lives that are lost every day in America because of guns. 
In 2017 there were at least 346 mass shootings in the U.S. You‚Äôre bragging about not having done anything to stop them. Use the small amount of brain cells you have to think about that. 
Actually, polls show Americans hold a net unfavorable view of the NRA. 
No. We have an administration that panders to the gun lobby and prioritizes the desires of the @NRA over American lives. 
Commonsense gun reforms would be a good place for you to start. 
Trump did not attend a funeral for the victims of the Parkland shooting. But this weekend, he's taking the time to address the @NRA for the 4th year in a row. He is the first sitting president to do so. 
"The vetting of the caravan shows that the immigration laws are quite strict, and that they work. That Mr. Trump says otherwise shows he sees not a group of fearful people fleeing from terror to freedom, but an opportunity to fan the flames of bigotry." 
UDW members joined @GavinNewsom for a discussion on #IncomeInequality today. Lt. Gov Newsom is committed to protecting the IHSS caregiver program and tackling the long-term #carecrisis 
Live now discussing income inequality in CA. CA is a place of unparalleled economic opportunity. But for too many, our econ recovery is a spectator sport. Fighting income inequality is the defining economic challenge of our time. We must face it head on. 
This is America's reality. Easier to purchase a gun than a cup of coffee. 
Oklahoma lawmakers have passed a bill that allows adoption agencies to ban LGBT couples. Not allowing a child to have qualified, loving parents simply because of who they love is absurd, discriminatory, and wrong. 
@cynthiahealthed Thank you!! Sounds clich√©, but they really do grow up so fast! 
Just finished up a Facebook live with the toughest interviewer I know -- my 8 year old daughter, Montana!! Watch here! ‚Äî&gt; 
Things CA believes to be true: - Science - Climate change - Scott Pruitt is a disaster - Trump will sell our policies off to the highest bidder So yes, we‚Äôre suing. 
We wouldn‚Äôt have the minimum wage, overtime, workers comp, or the weekend without organized labor. Now more than ever it‚Äôs so important for us to protect a worker‚Äôs voice on the job. #MayDay 
Actually, it‚Äôs just a physical manifestation of your idiocy. A 1,900 mile waste of taxpayer money that is impossible to complete. Rivers, mountains, tribal land, private land, and countless other obstacles make it more like Swiss cheese than an insurmountable barrier. 
Meanwhile, Rubio at an event just 2 weeks ago with Trump: ‚ÄúI want to thank you for fighting for the American worker. And they‚Äôve been beat up and ignored for far too long. Whether it‚Äôs taxes, whether it‚Äôs jobs sent to other countries, this tax reform is about them.‚Äù 
Phyllis and Del had been together for over 50 YEARS but were never given the right to marry. One of the greatest moments of my life was allowing them to tie the knot. It changed me forever and serves as a reminder everyday -- it's always the right time to do the right thing. 
Cecile is our hero because of the way she persevered in the face of unimaginable challenges. She never let the vitriol intimidate her. She stood strong, defended the rights of women who needed it most, and carried many of us on her back. #ThankYouCecile 
To sum it up, Paul Ryan is so scared of his own shadow he is arresting high schoolers and firing Chaplains. Noted. 
Spent my day meeting with CA‚Äôs Disability Community ‚Äî some of the most inspiring and thoughtful people I‚Äôve ever met. Left to see our President proclaiming the Paralympics are ‚Äúa little tough to watch too much of.‚Äù Hey, @realDonaldTrump - You‚Äôre an absolute disgrace. 
Egregious? CA‚Äôs gun murder rate has declined by 65 PERCENT since we started imposing tough gun laws in the 90s. If you're a felon banned from owning a gun, you shouldn't be able to purchase ammunition. We're focused on saving lives. Let me know when you begin to do the same. 
What does the #FutureofManhood look like? How do we raise our boys to be part of the gender equality solution? Honored to discuss these questions and more with Gary Barker, CEO of @Promundo_US. Via @Refinery29 
Walking the halls of my old high school this morning with my niece and some of the students. Inspired by everything these kids are doing to change our culture, inspire each other, and register voters! 
Love you! 
Thank you, San Luis Obispo for having me today!! 
Good news, but DREAMers deserve a permanent solution. They deserve to have the @GOP stop playing politics with their lives and pass a clean DREAM act. 
This is horrifying, heartbreaking, and maddening all at once. No one should ever feel threatened because of their religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or color of their skin. Never stop believing we CAN be better than this. 
Thank you @Promundo_US (and @tolulawrence too ). Beyond grateful for this honor, and excited for all of the work to come. #FutureofManhood 
@GoRiverCity Thanks! My plan is on my website, check out the link in the tweet! :) 
Today I met w/the dedicated staff at Shenandoah Early Ed Center. The ladder of opportunity starts at the beginning. 85% of brain development happens before the age of 3. We need to double down on our early ed programs make universal preschool a reality. 
Governor Hogan has an A-rating by the @NRA. He just signed three new commonsense gun reform bills into law. Governors across the country should take note. Thank you, Gov. Hogan for your leadership. 
96 Americans are killed every day by guns. This is a crisis. And rather than attempting to solve the issue, our leaders are off pandering to those who block commonsense gun legislation. It's immoral, disgraceful, pathetic, and weak. @VP -- not sure how you even sleep at night. 
Proud to march in commemoration of the 103rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. We're living in a world where some are constantly trying to suppress the truth, say that facts don't matter. It's time to recognize reject the hatred and bigotry that brought about this atrocity. 
Reminder: the newest member of Trump's "expert" legal team, Rudy Giuliani, was a proponent of sanctuary policy: "To control immigration by creating a disincentive for a woman to report to the police that she has been beaten...is a horrible position for the federal govt to take." 
I'm proud to have been the first Mayor to recognize marriage equality. The first to create a universal healthcare system. And the first to have taken on the @NRA and pass a comprehensive gun safety initiative. Check out our first ad that's up statewide - 6 weeks to Election Day! 
Climate Change should not be a partisan issue. It's time to recognize it for what it is -- a fact, a reality -- and do everything in our power to create a more sustainable earth for generations to come. #EarthDay 
This is pretty incredible and very moving. Rest in peace, grace, and power, Barbara Bush. 
Could not be more proud of our state for leading the way on this issue. 
Mike Pence‚Äôs true character reveals itself once again. 
‚ÄúSpecial Council.‚Äù When you figure out what that is, let us know. 
Legalizing marijuana is about criminal justice reform. It's about putting an end to the failed war on drugs and fixing a broken system that has disproportionately affected low-income and minority communities. It's time for our leaders in D.C. to step up. 
This is Havana Edwards. She‚Äôs 7-years-old. She was the only one at her school to walk out of classes today. When asked she said, ‚ÄúI'm going to tell my friends I did this, and then next time there will be more of us. That means we're winning." Havana, you inspire us all!! 
Proud to have your support! The impacts of climate change are already being felt, from CA's devastating droughts, to wildfires and mudslides. Our state must remain at the forefront of environmental leadership as we tackle some of the planet‚Äôs greatest challenges. 
19 years ago we experienced the tragedy of Columbine. Since then: -206,000+ students have experienced gun violence at school -131+ kids, educators others have been killed on campus -271 injured -7 even deadlier mass shootings have occurred in the U.S. 
Congress should STOP taking NRA and START listening to students on gun violence. Join us this Friday: #NationalSchoolWalkout 
Amazing! Sen. Tammy Duckworth made history today by bringing her baby onto the Senate floor during a vote. 
Conversion therapy is the emotional torture against some of our most innocent citizens -- our children -- telling them if they want to live, they have to lie about who they are and who they love. It must be stopped. 
Every Californian deserves access to quality, affordable healthcare. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm excited to have the support of @cmaphysicians and California‚Äôs physician community. Together, we will achieve universal access and improve patient care! 
What we need is comprehensive immigration reform. What we need is to renew DACA and for you to stop playing politics with people's lives. What we need is for you to stop trying to waste $$ on building an idiotic wall. Work on those things and get back to us, @realDonaldTrump. 
‚ÄúWhy do ‚Äòimportant' people only come around when something bad happens? We walked out for Parkland; who's walking out for us? There is a realness, a truth to the points these freshmen make.‚Äù 
It's been 7 months since Hurricane Maria. Today, the entire island of Puerto Rico has no power. Hurricane season is 6 weeks away. 
My wife is a BOSS. 
There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many cities want OUT of Trump's ridiculous xenophobic policies. Jerry Brown is trying to defend CA's values, but the people of the Trump Administration are not happy. Want restoration of commonsense policies and decency NOW! 
‚ÄúAt the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a friend or a parent." 
A little mid-week pick me up... "How hard you work matters more than how much you make...helping others means more than just getting ahead yourself....and the truth matters...because being President doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are." 
The @GOP should listen to Cardi B. 
Giving away billions to corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working families is not something you should be proud of. 
CA needs a system of universal health access that puts patients providers first, instead of for-profit plans like #Anthem. I support AB 2427. It gives State more power to combat anti-competitive practices of for-profit HMOs trying to maximize profit by minimizing patient access 
Quietly? No. We cannot let this man continue to tear apart important programs that help underserved communities. 
Honored to have your support and the 2.1 million Californians that you represent. In the face of Trump‚Äôs constant attacks on working families and the right to work, I‚Äôm proud to partner with you to create economic growth and inclusion that can be a model for the nation. 
Dead set on preserving his legacy of wrecking the middle class and being completely out of touch. 
#HolocaustRemembranceDay is not just about remembering and honoring the lives lost. It's about teaching this generation, and generations to come, about the importance of speaking out in the face of evil, denying bigotry, resisting injustice, and rejecting hate. 
Mike Pompeo refuses to answer if he thinks being gay is a perversion. We cannot allow this man to represent our nation. 
Nothing to see here still.... 
Say it with us now... Arming. Teachers. Will. Not. Make. Students. Safer. 
There are only 2 countries in the world that require someone's freedom to be based on their ATM balance: the Philippines and the United States. It's disgusting that we continue to allow predatory lenders to benefit from our unjust and immoral system. 
GOOD. BYE. 
.@SpeakerRyan now you can put country over party and allow a vote on universal background checks over 90% of Americans support it why not allow a vote on it? Tweet your support with #AllowTheVote 
Happy #NationalSiblingDay to my Sis -- Hilary!! 
The wage gap is complex: We devalue jobs that we've feminized. We make it hard for mothers to stay in the workforce full time. We penalize women who speak out and ask for more. So in order to create a world that truly values women, we must first address our values. #EqualPayDay 
Thank you @GavinNewsom for your support of our reelection today! 
Women have to work until TODAY to make what their male counterparts made LAST YEAR. The wage gap is real, and the wealth gap is STAGGERING. On average, women own just 32 cents to the dollar of what men do. And it's worse for women of color. It's time for a change. #EqualPayDay 
Congratulations, @SenDuckworth!! 
The @NRA has continuously undermined our public safety. Now, they want to undermine the right to vote. 
-1 in 5 Americans have protested or participated in a rally since 2016. -19% of those said they‚Äôd never joined a march or a political gathering before. -83% of protestors rally goers have said they are going to vote in 2018. Let‚Äôs bring about change. 
Happy birthday to the man who taught me no speech is complete until you‚Äôve quoted Plutarch, @JerryBrownGov! 
#CTAStateCouncil @GavinNewsom CA leads the way on curbing gun violence #WeSayNoMore 
@GavinNewsom to speak soon! #ctastatecouncil 
Equality isn't a place or somewhere to get to, it's a direction. The fight for true equality is fought and won through each conversation we have - with our colleagues, family, friends, and adversaries. We can all play a part in bringing about real change. #FairShare4Equality 
It's almost time to hear from our friend @GavinNewsom at #FairShare4Equality!! Head over to our Instagram for a livestream at 3pm! 
Anthony is just 15 years old. He barricaded a door in his classroom, preventing the Parkland gunman from coming in, and was shot five times. He was released from the hospital this week. In awe of his courage. 
‚ÄúSo we know what we‚Äôre up against. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre all here. We need to mobilize our community to defend the progress we‚Äôve made and continue to push the needle forward toward a world that is healthy, just and fully equal for all #LGBTQ people.‚Äù -@Rick_Zbur #FairShare4Equality 
Important warning from a very wise source. Let's not look back on this and wish we would have listened. It's up to us to defend the truth, the free press, activate new voters, and never allow anyone to be above the law. There's never "nothing to be done." 
We socialize boys AND girls to think that women are valuable only for their youth and beauty - and not for their minds. It has consequences. 
Important read. Targeting this initiative does nothing to prevent gun violence in schools. Instead, it will result in the reversing of civil rights protections for marginalized communities. 
‚ÄúDraining the swamp‚Äù 
Honored to have the support of one of CA‚Äôs greatest leaders, @HildaSolis! As a Congresswoman, Labor Secretary, and Supervisor, Hilda has always been an advocate for working families, standing up for CA values and fighting against those trying take advantage of immigrants. 
The President of the United States is spreading conspiracy theories that flame xenophobia and racism. Even if this happens nearly every day, I refuse to allow this to be normal. 
OHHH the irony of claiming massive voter fraud when the only thing fraudulent is, in fact, your claim. 
Says the guy who put together a pointless committee on this very subject that was later shut down because it failed to produce a single piece of real evidence of the ‚Äúmillions of illegal voters.‚Äù CA will stick with the facts, thanks. 
Powerful video put together by Stevie Wonder. My dream is that we may all one day live in a world free of racism, inequality, and xenophobia. A world in which we don't just tolerate our diversity, we celebrate it. #DreamStillLives 
Ivanka and Jared over here trying to casually bid on a woman‚Äôs ability to make her own decisions. 
50 years ago we lost one of our greatest uniters and most courageous leaders. His teachings continue to challenge us today to never simply accept the status quo. That it's never the wrong time to do the right thing. And that the fight for true equality justice continues. #MLK50 
You have defended a President who called white supremacists ‚Äúvery fine people.‚Äù 
Such an honor to have had you as a father and to still have you as a teacher. I greatly admire your courage and strength to love, and I learn from you daily. In the words of Maya Angelou, I ‚Äúcan be and be better because you existed.‚Äù Thank you. Miss you. #MLK #MLK50Forward 
Our nation is being torn apart by gun violence. No one should ever have to go to work, school, a concert, or a place of worship in fear of getting shot. 
Polluting our air for generations to come is not putting America first. 
Should be noted....this is false. ‚Äî&gt; 
Shouldn‚Äôt be lost in Trump‚Äôs Tweetstorm that he casually called a former president ‚ÄúCheatin‚Äô‚Äù this morning. 
Yet again, Trump's EPA has chosen to dismiss the existence of science. Their attempts to drag our state and nation backward are outright reckless. California will not be bullied into denying climate change. 
The Easter Bunny‚Äôs face sums it all up for me. 
This weekend is a reminder that out of darkness, can come light. That we should always strive to choose love over hate, and faith over fear. Whether you‚Äôre celebrating Passover, Easter, or simply spending time with loved ones, wishing you all a joyous weekend! 
‚ÄúThe fight is never about grapes or lettuce. It is always about people.‚Äù Today, we remember a man who was willing to step up, step in and demand change. A man who dedicated his life to bettering the lives of others and became one of our greatest leaders. #CesarChavezDay 
Today, we lift up our #transgender brothers and sisters and recognize all they have accomplished ‚Äî and the trails they continue to blaze. On this #TDOV, you are not just seen, you are celebrated. #TransisBeautiful 
Chag Sameach! Wishing everyone who is celebrating tonight a happy Passover! 
LGBT Americans should be counted like they should be treated, equally. Without this count, the government cannot do its job to ensure the LGBT community has the protections and services they need. 
Casual......... 
It‚Äôs simple. The Census needs to count every person. This is a terrible decision that jeopardizes the integrity of our democracy and risks a loss of representation for our communities along with millions in aid for health, education, and infrastructure. 
Linda Brown was a trailblazer who forever changed our nation, knowing that separate will never be equal. Her life will forever serve as a reminder of the power, courage, and incredible impact so many young people have on our nation. Rest in power, Linda. 
Over 40 students are marching 50 miles to call out Paul Ryan. This generation is not messing around. And I love it. 
In a SHOCKING turn of events Rick Santorum proves to the world once again that he completely lacks any form of decency, intelligence, or common sense. Please go away now. 
You don't need a title or an elected office to change the world. We all have the capacity to create change by stepping up demanding more. Proud to have joined students across CA as they exercised their moral authority demanded an end to gun violence. 
So inspiring to see all these constituents at the student-led #MarchForOurLives in Orange County with @GavinNewsom @TomSteyer. We're all demanding action to #EndGunViolence won't stop until our elected officials like @RepMimiWalters, @RepEdRoyce @DanaRohrabacher listen. 
Here with thousands in Santa Ana, CA marching to end gun violence. Listening to our LtGov @GavinNewsom. "Gun control saves lives." #March4OurLives 
Here with thousands in Santa Ana, CA marching to end gun violence. Listening to our LtGov @GavinNewsom. "Gun control saves lives." #March4OurLives 
‚ÄúGun safety saves lives. That ain‚Äôt fake news‚Äù -@GavinNewsom #MarchForOurLives 
Together, I know we can tell our elected officials and the @NRA that our laws are NOT for sale. We do this for our teachers. We do this for our children. We do this for the generations to come. The time is now, the movement is here, now let‚Äôs create the change. 
We must continue to fight back against the dangerous rhetoric of the @NRA -- but we cannot do it alone. It will take each one of us, talking with our neighbors, our colleagues. Calling our legislators. Writing letters to our leaders. Protesting peacefully. 
This cannot end today. With a President and a Congress more focused on lining their pockets with @NRA cash than saving lives, it is more important now than ever that we stand together and demand more. It‚Äôs time we raise our voices and say we have had ENOUGH. 
It is the millions ‚Äî literally, millions ‚Äî of conversations that students and everyone marching today are holding - and winning - on gun violence that are changing our nation. 
We cannot stop raising our voices until every child, mother, father, brother, sister, community member, is safe at school, a concert, a mall, or a park. No one deserves to live their life in fear of being shot. But that‚Äôs the sad reality of today. 
Today is a day for the history books. 
Nancy‚Äôs tenacity and determination were contagious. She was brilliant, kind to everyone, never wanted the credit or glory, always dedicated to her boss and bettering California. The world has lost a truly amazing public servant and friend. You will be deeply missed. 
California's heart aches with the tragic loss of Stephon Clark and we grieve with his family. It's time to acknowledge some hard truths - a suspect that looks like me would still be alive. Stephon isn't. That must change. 
Upwards of a million people in CA live in homes with contaminated drinking water. It‚Äôs an embarrassment that so many go home at night and can‚Äôt drink from the faucet or bathe their kids safely . We need to work together to solve this moral crisis. #WorldWaterDay 
Oh you mean THIS study? The one that you deliberately misrepresent? The one that concludes we absolutely need the very research that @NRA and the spokespeople / congressional members they own continue to block? --&gt; 
More than a little ironic that the NRA says we must be supplied with the facts, but has spent the last 20+ years blocking the CDC from researching gun violence. 
Time to demand more of our elected leaders who have cowered in fear of the @NRA for far too long. Enough. 
With two legends from San Francisco‚Äî@GavinNewsom and John Burton! 
Toni Atkins is making history as the first woman and LGBTQ Pro Tem, but what makes her truly extraordinary is her authenticity, intellect and compassion. She will be one of CA‚Äôs great Senate leaders. Proud to stand by her side on this historic day. 
For the first time in nearly two decades, the majority of Americans are saying they have had enough of the @NRA. Keep raising your voices. Keep demanding change. It's working. 
‚ÄúThere may be setbacks; you may sometimes feel like progress is too slow in coming. But we have no doubt you are going to make an enormous difference in the days and years to come, and we will be there for you.‚Äù Couldn't agree more. 
Ben Carson openly admitted he is slow walking protections for the LGBT community. This man's blatant disregard for equal rights and uninformed, anti-transgender policies should not be tolerated. Don't let this be the norm. 
The War on Drugs was a failure. We need real resources to solve the opioid crisis. Trump's proposals to cut hundreds of billions from Medicaid programs threaten the progress states have made to confront this epidemic. 
California is the nation's largest food producer, and we do it by embracing diversity and innovation. Today we celebrate all those that contribute to this important part of our economy and culture. Happy #NationalAgDay! 
States with more gun provisions consistently see fewer gun deaths. 
The Repro FACT Act is a straightforward law in CA ensuring pregnant people receive accurate info about their full range of #reprohealth care options. Anti-abortion extremists are challenging it (again) in SCOTUS case NIFLA v. Becerra. #EndTheLies #ExposeFakeClinics #PPHearsYou 
Nowruz Mubarak! Wishing all those celebrating today a joyful and healthy new year! 
Today's incident at Great Mills High School in Maryland marks the 11th time a gun has been discharged in a K-12 school since the Parkland shooting: @GunDeaths 
You are the one who ended DACA. 
At a time when many in the Dem party did not support marriage equality, Kate was a force whose leadership gave us the courage to marry over 4,000 couples. And that‚Äôs just one in a long list of fights Kate has taken on, and won. Grateful for her leadership! 
It was a pleasure a privilege to meet @GavinNewsom, 49th Lt. Gov. of California, Irish-American true friend of #Ireland. Great to engage share knowledge on our many areas of common interest. #stpatricksday #globalirish 
Tybre is just 10 years old. He loves football, history, boats, and activism. This past week he drove 7 hours to meet his hero, @repjohnlewis and walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. This next generation gives me so much hope. 
Stopped by @Postmates today for a Town Hall with their employees! Really enjoyed our thoughtful conversation around how we can create more sustainable jobs in CA. 
"A lot of us think that we‚Äôre invincible, that the things that happen on the news take place in a world separate from our own." - Emma, 18. 
"Fight for the things that you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you." Happy Birthday to #NotoriousRBG! A fierce leader in the fight for true justice and equality. 
This is Leonardo Aguilar. He's just 8 years old and was the only one to walk out of his second grade class to protest gun violence. Leonardo, thank you for your courage!! We're all so inspired by kids like you. 
WATCH: California students spell out #Enough during protest against gun violence #NationalWalkoutDay 
The culmination of their #neveragain protest: Berkeley High students form a human peace-sign on the football field. 
This is what leadership looks like. #ENOUGH #NotOneMore #StudentsDemandAction 
Together, young and old, we can be the generations that end gun violence and make a safer America for everyone. - @JenSiebelNewsom 
Our kids are dying and we're doing nothing to stop it. #EnoughIsEnough 
You have such a STRONG voice. Keep using it. Keep marching. Keep walking out. Cause some good trouble. #NationalSchoolWalkout 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna be the cause of a revolution.‚Äù @MaddyMini #ENOUGH 
Seventeen students holding the names of the seventeen lives taken in Parkland. Powerful. Heartbreaking. We have had #ENOUGH. 
Just arrived in Sacramento and so proud to be here supporting these student activists. Beyond inspired and ready for change. #NotOneMore #ENOUGH 
So inspired by the next generation of leaders stepping up and demanding more. Thank you to all the students participating in the #NationalSchoolWalkout around the country. Your courage will help lead the way for change. #EnoughIsEnough 
"Very poor job running" the state: - 6th largest economy in the world. - Continually outpaces the U.S. in job growth. - Turned a 2010 deficit into a record surplus. - Leads the national economy from personal income to high-wage jobs and more. 
California is not "begging" you for this wall. Your wall is a waste of money and is literally impossible to complete. It will look more like a piece of swiss cheese than an insurmountable barrier. It's nothing more than a 6th century solution to a 21st century problem. 
That moment when the only people who will back you up are an anti-immigrant, fear-mongering, far-right hate group. 
So @realDonaldTrump has finally worked up the nerve to come to CA and visit his precious wall -- a 1900 mile monument to idiocy that is literally IMPOSSIBLE to complete. We cannot let this small, scared bully hurt our economy and turn ICE into his own personal army of hate. 
SHOCKER: Our spineless coward of a President actually is scared of the @NRA after all. 
Watching the President attack the press and use this kind of rhetoric is truly disturbing. This man will stop at nothing to boost his own ego. His constant racism, misogyny, and shaming of the press is outright dangerous, repulsive, and a stain on our democracy and our country. 
Today, we mourn the loss of 3 courageous women who dedicated their lives to caring for others were tragically killed in Yountville. Jennifer, Christine, and Jennifer thank you for serving those who served our country. Our hearts break for your loved ones. You will be missed. 
If you are concerned about a loved one who may be sheltering in place at the Yountville Veterans Home, you can call 707-948-3331 for more information. Updates on the situation will continue on my page and you can also check @CountyofNapa. 
UDW is proud to endorse @GavinNewsom for Governor. 100,000 caregivers stand with Gavin to fix California's care crisis. 
In honor of #InternationalWomensDay wanted you all to get to know the most important woman in my life ‚Äî @JenSiebelNewsom! Not only is she my wife, but she‚Äôs also a filmmaker and the founder and CEO of @TheRepProject (and all around boss lady)! 
Happy #InternationalWomensDay! From equal pay, to the right to choose, to universal paid family leave, to equal representation at all levels of leadership, more must be done to support and empower women and achieve true equality. Let‚Äôs keep up the fight. 
53 years ago today, we were beaten, tear gassed, trampled by horses, and left bloody on the bridge in Selma. On this anniversary, we cannot rest. We must honor those who gave their lives for the right to vote. We must continue to find a way to get in the way. #goodtrouble 
Honestly couldn't be more proud that Jeff Sessions called me an embarrassment... 
Sessions and Trump are suing California over our immigration policies. Wasn't too long ago that members of THEIR OWN PARTY thought otherwise. Here's Rudy Giuliani defending Sanctuary policy when he was Mayor of New York: 
Sessions and Trump should really do their homework before they decide to sue CA. Sanctuary counties have: - Fewer crimes committed - Higher median household incomes - Lower poverty rates - Lower unemployment rates These policies keep us safe, and allow communities to thrive. 
Live now! Make sure to tune in --&gt; 
I'm going live at 1:30pm to respond to Jeff Sessions calling me an "embarrassment," and to talk with Californians who have been threatened by @realDonaldTrump's immigration policies. Watch here --&gt; 
Jeff Sessions just called me an embarrassment. A man whose legacy is targeting immigrants, re-waging the failed War on Drugs, sucking-up to private prison profiteers, and apologizing for white supremacists... I take that as a HUGE compliment. 
Sanctuary policies (like SB-54) keep our communities safe and are consistent with the Constitution. Hope you‚Äôre paying attention @jeffsessions and @realDonaldTrump because CA has a message for you: We will not be bullied into accepting your ‚Äúfear of everything‚Äù agenda. 
I for one would love to hear from young people about their hopes for the future. If you are a kid who has something to say on this topic- Use your voice. THIS IS YOUR MOMENT. Make YOUR list of #WhatIf questions. 
Keep. It. Up. Change the status quo. Change the conversation. Change our laws. 
Making up things that happen in Sweden, with Sweden, about Sweden that have NEVER HAPPENED is Trump's favorite past time. Remember when he fabricated the terror incident that "happened last night in Sweden‚Äù that NEVER HAPPENED? 
And the award for the biggest narcissist goes to.... 
@PaulyGW71 @JenSiebelNewsom Thanks for your support! 
Fun yesterday at our old stomping ground as @GavinNewsom filed for #California governor. Poor Dutchie was sick but wasn‚Äôt going to miss it! 
Made it official and turned in my paperwork today to run for Governor! AND had the honor of the littlest Newsom joining us for the day :) 
They were incredible young men, hardworking, never missed practice, and had a positive impact on the people around them. These are the folks who are being deported because of Trump's political games. We must be better than this. 
No -- this is on you. Your willingness to damage lives so you can score some meaningless political points is repulsive. 
Fact check: President Trump derailed three bipartisan plans to fix the DACA crisis that he created. 
"Tell the NRA, you‚Äôre in God‚Äôs way." -@common Thank you for standing up and demanding more of our leaders. #Oscars 
Forget gun buybacks - we should launch an @GOP buyback from the NRA. How much would it take @SpeakerRyan? 
We've experienced a tectonic shift in cultural attitudes and behaviors thanks to the brave women who have demanded change. But it's not just women‚Äôs work. It‚Äôs men‚Äôs work too. It‚Äôs all of our work. @JenSiebelNewsom talks about how we must #AskMoreOfHim: 
An amazing woman to celebrate this #WomensHistoryMonth 
Doesn't it feel like you're here? Let your mind wander, and share with us some quiet moments from the idyllic morning snow we saw in Yosemite Valley today! 
Marco Rubio is the definition of a waste of space. 
In a move of complete and total desperation, Georgia attempts to punish @Delta for going against the @NRA. COULD YOU BE MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT YOUR WILLINGNESS TO BEND TO THE NRA FOR CASH. THX. 
You think a Mayor protecting their community is outrageous? Well, we think your racist, xenophobic policies are outrageous. 
Thank you, Chancellor White! 
Students are stepping up and demanding change from the cowardly @GOP. We should have their back. Today, I asked CA colleges to promise students they won't be penalized for participating in the National Walkout to Protest Gun Violence. Every school should do the same. 
Proud to support @GavinNewsom for Governor! He offers an inspiring vision which offers opportunity for all of us. 
My mom passed away over a decade ago. She was a single mom who worked 3 jobs and waitressed at night to support her two kids and my foster brother. She taught me everything I know about grit, hard work, and determination. Her example of leadership will live on forever for me. 
On the last day of #BlackHistoryMonth, we thought we‚Äôd share a few examples of who and what truly helped make this country great. Hopefully, @realDonaldTrump is taking notes. Pictured: Thurgood Marshall, 1st Black Supreme Court Justice #TheyMadeItGreat #BHM 
58 years ago today, I was arrested for the first time as a participant in the sit-ins at lunch counters in downtown Nashville. Walking out to the paddy wagons, I tried to walk with a sense of pride dignity. I felt free, I felt liberated. I felt like I crossed over. #goodtrouble 
The notion that we need to arm our teachers over passing smart gun laws is absurd. In 1993, CA strengthened its gun laws. From 1993-2013 CA‚Äôs gun murder rate declined by 65%. Smart gun laws work. Stop forcing teachers to become body guards because you won‚Äôt do your job. 
Wrong. The debate after #Parkland shows that the next generation has far more courage than you and the other @GOP lackeys who refuse to pass reforms that will SAVE LIVES because the @NRA cuts checks to your campaign. 
Californians ‚Äî especially our immigrant communities ‚Äî are under attack by @realDonaldTrump. We must protect immigrant families from these mass-deportations. Grateful for leaders like @LibbySchaaf. We cannot stand idly by as Trump rips apart CA families. 
Note what's missing in this tweet: a commitment. The @NRA has purchased Paul Ryan's soul. I guess that's what $49,650 gets you these days. 
Worked out really well for the last guy who claimed Witch Hunt. 
I‚Äôm surprised the NRA was affiliated with car rental companies at all, considering Hertz and Avis enforce tyrannical rules like "age restrictions" and "having a license." 
The SCOTUS Janus case isn‚Äôt about the 1st amendment, it‚Äôs an effort to weaken our workers‚Äô ability for fair pay, benefits, and a secure retirement. 
Happy anniversary!! 
Happy birthday Dutch!! We love you! 
"We demand the right for women to choose, and we will always protect Planned Parenthood." ‚Äî@GavinNewsom #CADem2018 #PPHearsYou 
It‚Äôs time to choose courage. Courage for a change. 
This is more than a political campaign. It's about Democrats acting like Democrats‚Äîin a battle for America's soul against a President without one. 
They said: ‚Äúpick your battles.‚Äù We passed the state's highest minimum wage and took guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals. 
They said: ‚Äúpick your battles.‚Äù We created the nation‚Äôs first citywide universal health care plan. 
They said: ‚Äúpick your battles.‚Äù We said ‚Äúlove is love‚Äù and issued 4,036 same-sex marriage licenses in a winter of love. 
My whole life, we‚Äôve faced down skeptics. Defeatist Democrats who suggest we need to ‚Äúpick our battles.‚Äù 
No child should ever be afraid of going to school because cowardly politicians are afraid of a paper tiger called the @NRA. 
Enough with these can't do politicians. We can‚Äîand we must‚Äîdemand that no child in this state be raised in poverty. 
Enough with these can't do politicians. We CAN build enough affordable housing to put a roof over everyone‚Äôs head. 
Enough with these can't do politicians. We CAN build a modern economy that works for everyone‚Äîone that rewards innovation, closes the wage and wealth gap for women, and respects organized labor. 
Enough with these "can't do" politicians. We CAN race faster to a future free of fossil fuels and fracking. 
We demand an end to the systemic racism of mass incarceration. And while we're at it, let‚Äôs slam the door shut on cash bail and private prisons. 
And we demand health care for every person ‚Äî regardless of immigration status. 
We demand the right for women to choose ‚Äî and we will always protect Planned Parenthood. 
We demand a life of dignity and security for seniors. 
We demand a public education system that is the best in the world ‚Äî and rejects the worst impulses of Betsy DeVos. 
My opponents in this race have spent a lot of time telling us what CAN‚ÄôT be done. We need a Governor who says what CAN be done. One who has the courage to demand more. 
At our best, we don‚Äôt tolerate our diversity‚Äîwe celebrate it. We defend our DREAMers. We demand equality. And we disrupt the corrupt‚Äîbut only when we have the courage of our convictions. When we dream bigger and reach higher. The time for timidity is OVER. 
Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm voting for @GavinNewsom ‚úîÔ∏è Single-payer for all ‚úîÔ∏è Champion for LGBTQ rights ‚úîÔ∏è A warrior for the environment ‚úîÔ∏è Will fight Donald Trump‚Äôs policies every single day #CADem2018 #TeamGavin 
Emma is leading the change we need to see in this country. Let‚Äôs strip the @NRA‚Äôs power to purchase our laws. 
Ended the night with @CAYoungDems @CFA_News and @GavinNewsom - Great first day to @CA_Dem #CADEM2018 #CADEM18 
Great to see my friend @RobBonta at #CADem2018! Honored to have his support in my race for Gov. He‚Äòs been a leader on bail reform and ending a corrupt system that allows a person‚Äôs freedom to be based on their ATM balance. 
With the next First Lady of California @jensiebelnewsom @gavinnewsom 
The @CalNurses sure know how to deck out a bus!! And @JenSiebelNewsom makes it look even better! 
Watching the conspiracy-fueled vitriol at CPAC today reminded me just how grateful I am to be here at #CADem2018. Grateful for the fighters at every level who are building a California Dream that rejects hate and celebrates our shared humanity. 
Stoked to be at #CADem2018 with an awesome team of volunteers. Across the country, the young energy in this party right now is . Time for us ALL to listen up. 
Our values are under attack by an Admin that's moving our country backwards. We believe in: Healthcare Pay equity The end of the War on Drugs Eliminating cash bail And that the @NRA cannot buy our laws. Let's show @realDonaldTrump what a bold, progressive future looks like. 
Young people have helped lead all our great movements. How inspiring to see it again in so many smart, fearless students standing up for their right to be safe; marching and organizing to remake the world as it should be. We've been waiting for you. And we've got your backs. 
The @GOP has become the party of self-serving leadership. But the #ParklandStudents are showing America another way forward, leading not with self-interest but with a desire to serve others. Let us follow their example. Read more of my thoughts here @TIME: 
30 different studies found places w more guns are less safe. Then the NRA got Congress to shut down the research. 
TRUTH. 
He. Has. No. Soul. 
California is with you. Keep raising your voices. Keep marching. Keep protesting. Keep demanding more of your elected officials. 
@jennabeck1 Anytime, thanks for the tweet -- and your support! 
It's Eden Hebron's 15th birthday today. Instead of celebrating with her friends, she's reading a poem about the death of her best friend and surviving the terror that was Parkland, Florida. 
Senate President-Elect Toni Atkins has been a fierce leader for equality, healthcare for all, and solving the housing crisis here in California. Couldn‚Äôt be more excited that she - and her amazing wife - are supporting my race for Governor! Thank you, @toniatkins! 
You forgot the ‚Äúthis message has been paid for by the @NRA‚Äù tagline at the end, you coward. 
Today, in a room full of kids, a brave young man stood up and, holding back emotion, told me he‚Äôs afraid to go to school. Then one by one the kids told of guns they‚Äôd seen at their schools. These kids think the ‚Äúgrown ups‚Äù running America are insane. I‚Äôm with the kids. 
This morning I welcomed @GavinNewsom to #CA15 at the @LiUNA304 Hall in Hayward. He's been with us all along. You know who he is, and he knows who you are. And I know he's going to be a great governor of California. 
Happy Lunar New Year to all those celebrating! Wishing you all a joyous and prosperous #YearOfTheDog! 
I've known @KamalaHarris for over two decades. From our work in San Francisco together, to her work in Washington, DC, she has always been an outspoken advocate and fearless fighter for California's progressive values. Honored to have her support in my race for Governor! 
I'll be going live at 2pm to unveil our biggest endorsement yet -- make sure to tune in! 
California is both America‚Äôs richest state, and its poorest. We need growth and inclusion -- an economy that shares the energy and diversity of this state and works for every Californian. 
Every time violence erupts, we learn that the perpetrator was a "loner," "didn't have many friends," or "was socially isolated." Tell our education leaders and elected officials: End community violence now! 
The @NRA is completely complicit in yesterday's shooting, as are all our leaders who have done nothing to stop this violence. If you cannot protect the kids of this country, you should not maintain any position of influence or power. 
The @NRA is nothing more than a paper tiger. We all have the capacity to DO SOMETHING to stop the gun violence that has plagued our country for far too long. Went live to give my thoughts: 
Cost of this line for the @NRA: $3,303,355 Cost of this line for @marcorubio: His soul. 
Vegas Festival: 58 killed Pulse club: 49 killed VA Tech: 32 killed Sandy Hook: 27 killed Sutherland Springs: 26 killed Killeen, TX: 23 killed San Ysidro: 21 killed U of TX: 18 killed Parkland, FL: At least 17 killed Until we make a change, yesterday will continue to happen. 
The Warriors' Steve Kerr with a strong statement on gun reform after the latest tragedy in Florida 'It doesn't seem to matter to our government that children are being shot to death, day after day in schools...' (via @ChrisBHaynes + @espn) 
Then do something about it. 
Then do something about it. 
Then do something about it. 
Then do something about it. 
Then do something about it. 
Then do something about it. 
Our children are dying and we're doing nothing to stop it. I'm running out of words to describe my anger, frustration, and sadness. So today I have one message: If you're unwilling to step up and demand reform, get out of office. #GunControlNow 
Leobardo, Kamau, Kevin, and Sadhana embody what it means to be an American. Their courage and perseverance should be met with hope and encouragement, not fear of deportation. 
All my other valentines in one picture together! On the road today and missing these smiling faces!!! 
Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day to my rock and forever partner, @JenSiebelNewsom! Love you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Happy #ValentinesDay to all who have stood and fought to say: Love is love. 
In this critical time for California as income inequality grows and attacks on labor continues @SEIU1000 is endorsing @GavinNewsom for governor, who will fight for fair wages, good benefits and a secure retirement. 
Great to be with @LAdemocrats tonight talking about how we can make big, bold, progressive ideas happen here in CA! 
Trump's budget cuts Social Security by $72 billion, Medicare by $266 billion, and Medicaid by $1.1 trillion. 
Honored to have the endorsement of the 700,000 working people of SEIU California and proud to share their vision for a strong, diverse, dynamic and just California. The key to accomplishing economic equity is ensuring more working people have the power and the right to organize. 
.@Aetna is the latest example of out-of-state for-profit health insurance putting profits ahead of CA patients. It's why we need bold reform that allows providers to focus on patient care and guarantees health access to everyone in CA. Enough talk - it's time to deliver. 
Amazing!! Congrats, Chloe! 
Our fight for marriage equality is a real testament to something we all have -- a remarkable capacity to do great things as long as we step up and step in. 
Reminder that our Attorney General is an outright racist who wants us all to acknowledge "Anglo-American heritage." 
14 yrs ago today, SF‚Äôs then-mayor, @GavinNewsom granted the 1st official same-sex marriage licenses, thrusting #MarriageEquality into the national spotlight. We thank our #LGBT heroes, of course (#EdieWindsor, @JimObergefell), but we also thank allies like Newsom. #LGBTHistory 
14 years ago today, we made history by issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in San Francisco. Since then, we've continued to lead the way from universal healthcare to standing up to the NRA. Because in California we know: it's never the wrong time to do the right thing. 
Wait ‚Äî does that mean that not standing up is a way of peacefully protesting and expressing your views, @VP? ü§î 
Trade between Canada California has created millions of middle class jobs and economic growth on both sides of the border. My thanks to @GavinNewsom for a great discussion on how we can increase trade. 
Great, far reaching conversation with @JustinTrudeau this morning about immigration, universal healthcare, and climate change. Plus, the guy‚Äôs got great hair! 
Nearly 2 MILLION kids live in poverty in California. We should never read that, shrug, and move on. We've got to step up and demand more of ourselves and our state to solve child poverty. 
Same GOP Congress that passed an unfunded $1.5T corporate tax cut is now shutting down the government because they believe we can‚Äôt afford to confront the opioid epidemic or invest in our own communities. 
Imagine how it feels to be those students. 
8 million Californians are living below the poverty line. Nearly 2 million children ‚Äî 1 in 5 ‚Äî live in poverty. We‚Äôre witnessing staggering levels of income wealth inequality. This is the defining challenge of our time. We need to face it head on. 
Beyond thrilled to have the support of @SenatorLeyva, a fearless defender of equality and champion for working people across our state! 
It's outrageous that Trump has proposed removing protections for public lands, opening up our coastlines to oil drilling, and pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement. California won't stand for it. We need to step up and push back. 
8 hours. From all of us to you, @NancyPelosi. 
THIS is what leadership looks like. Thank you. #GoNancyGo 
Got news for you, @realDonaldTrump -- not a single drop from your new oil plan will ever make landfall in CA. We will not be complacent in your deliberate partisan assault on our people and our economy. We will resist your cynical, regressive agenda. 
Claiming treason because people don‚Äôt clap at applause lines... leading chants of ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù and wanting to jail your opponents... banning words like ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù.... asking for military parades... sounds an awful lot like the @GOP would prefer this to be a dictatorship. 
Honored to have the support of the largest classified school employees union in America! 
... or they don‚Äôt trust Trump and are afraid to give over personal information since this administration has done nothing but demand a do-nothing wall while attempting to use their lives as bait for the Democrats. 
Wrong. No country in the world pays more per capita for healthcare and receives less than the United States. We‚Äôre paying the price tag of a universal healthcare system without receiving the benefits. We can‚Äôt afford NOT to make a change. 
PLEASE. STOP. 
Guess someone told Paul Ryan you shouldn‚Äôt go around praising yourself for giving a working person an extra $1.50 a week ‚Äî because he deleted this tweet. 
These kids know -- as we celebrate the contributions of Black Americans this month, it's also important to recognize the truth; Black history is and forever will be American history. #BlackHistoryMonth 
2018 so far: 32 days. 12 school shootings. Shameful doesn't even begin to cover it. 
We need to tackle housing and homelessness head on: spearheading 3.5 million new housing units, implementing stronger tenant protections, revamping our tax system appointing a Homelessness Secretary. Solving these issues is critical to ensuring everyone can call our state HOME. 
This example underscores the true promise of legalization ‚Äì providing new hope for those whose lives were derailed by a costly, broken, racially discriminatory system. This isn‚Äôt just an urgent issue of social justice in CA ‚Äì it‚Äôs a model for the nation. 
Reminder: this is who agrees with @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs immigration policies. 
Trump last night to Puerto Rico: "We are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together." Meanwhile, FEMA is going to stop providing food and water despite the fact that a third of residents still lack electricity. 
Humbled to have the support of Equality California, a steadfast leader and voice in the fight for equality in California and our nation. Thankful for the work you do and grateful to have you on the team! 
Watching #SOTU just reminds me how much I cannot wait for @IronStache to sweep the Cowardly Ryan into the ash bin of political history. 
Excited to watch our President showcase the profound depth of policy knowledge he‚Äôs acquired since first seeing his speech an hour ago. 
Thanks for telling us all in the third person that you‚Äôre a racist, but we already knew. 
We need to treat education as a lifelong pursuit, beginning before birth continuing until every child is prepared for a quality job. That means focusing on prenatal care, universal pre-K access, free community college and more. Every child deserves the opportunity to succeed. 
44 years ago today Nixon stood before Congress for his State of the Union and demanded that the Watergate investigation come to an end. "The time has come to bring that investigation and other investigations related to that matter to an end. One year of Watergate is enough!" 
This really sums it all up for me. 
Roe v. Wade was decided 45 years ago. Stop trying to interfere with women‚Äôs reproductive health decisions. Move on, @GOP. #NoAbortionBan

Tune into the Swearing-In of the 54th Speaker of the House, beginning at 10:45am ET ‚Äî&gt; 
Today is my last day as Speaker of the House, and this is the story of how I came to that decision. 
One of my last looks from the Speaker's balcony --&gt; I'll remember it well. 
This year we‚Äôve achieved real, meaningful entitlement reform ‚Äì without raising taxes. Learn more: 
Keeping the Pledge: Saving entitlements for today‚Äôs seniors future generations 
This bill marks the most significant reforms to #SocialSecurity since 1983: 
House Approves the Bipartisan Budget Act: 
20 Photos. 1 Speakership. See them all here: 
The Speakership in photos --&gt; 
Our goal has always been to replace Pres. Obama‚Äôs sequester w/ smarter cuts and reforms: 
A regular guy can‚Äôt do a big job alone. #ThankYou to all the staff here in the @uscapitol around the country. 
Common-sense reforms to #SocialSecurity in our Bipartisan Budget Agreement will save taxpayers billions: 
Every day, some 10,887 people go to work for the U.S. House. Grateful to every single one of them. 
The #BipartisanBudgetAct is fully paid for, will strengthen SS, save taxpayers billions over the long-term 
A big thank you to all of the people who go to work for the U.S. House of Representatives: 
NEWS: non-partisan experts confirm Bipartisan Budget Agreement is fully offset: 
Thank you @RepSteveChabot @RepMarcyKaptur the #Ohio delegation. Proud of the work we‚Äôve done together. 
Thank you, Cathy. Very nice gift from you the @HouseGOP team. 
The #BipartisanBudgetAct is a good deal for our troops, our taxpayers for the American people. 
Alternative to the #BipartisanBudgetAct was a ‚Äòclean‚Äô debt ceiling increase w/o any reforms or additional support for our troops. 
The #BipartisanBudgetAct rejects ALL of the tax increases proposed by the Obama administration. 
FACT: The #BipartisanBudgetAct protects more Americans from #ObamaCare. 
Plain and simple, the #BipartisanBudgetAct strengthens our national security. 
The #BipartisanBudgetAct secures more long-term entitlement reform. 
The #BipartisanBudgetAct will protect our economy reduce our deficit. 
Here are all the details about the Bipartisan Budget Act. Good for our troops Good for taxpayers. 
Tune in for my last press conference as Speaker of the House of Representatives, starting now: 
LIVE this morning at 10am ET: @HouseGOP leadership press conference: 
The best view in Washington, DC. 
If you do the right things for the right reasons, good things will happen. 
Education can should be the great equalizer ‚Äì lifting up kids who would otherwise slip through the cracks. 
It is unfortunate that the unions the education establishment in our country see #schoolchoice as a threat. 
The #DC Opportunity Scholarship Program has truly made a difference. Here's how: 
In my view, education ought to be the civil right of the 21st century. 
Just released: my final Weekly Republican Address on a subject that is near dear to my heart. Hope you‚Äôll watch. 
My gavel was carved from an old tree by a good friend. I'd say it's big enough --&gt; 
From the beginning, the #DC Opportunity Scholarship Program has been the little engine that could. 
New House select panel will have the resources ‚Äì and the subpoena power ‚Äì to get the full truth #PlannedParenthood 
The @uscapitol #ChristmasTree may soon be coming to your neck of the woods. 
The @uscapitol #ChristmasTree may soon be coming to your neck of the woods. 
There‚Äôs a great tradition to Speaker‚Äôs gavels. I'm particularly fond of this one: 
The #MonumentsMen reattached the tendons to the bone that is a civilization‚Äôs identity. 
.@RepMikeTurner is right. Pres. Obama‚Äôs #NDAA veto is ‚Äúunprecedented and reprehensible.‚Äù 
With this veto of the #FY16NDAA, our national security hangs in the balance. #FundOurTroops 
What Secretary Clinton told Egypt's Prime Minister the day after the #Benghazi attack: 
By placing domestic politics ahead of our troops, Pres. Obama has put America‚Äôs #nationalsecurity at risk 
Our fight to protect the sanctity of all human life continues #prolife 
Proud that - in my final week as Speaker - I'll be delivering the Weekly #Republican Address on a topic that is near dear to my heart. 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that in the back of the House chamber?‚Äù Check out this @USHouseHistory feature on some peculiar photos: 
Appointed the following members to select panel to investigate horrific #abortion practices: 
Knowing who we‚Äôre from shows our children who they can be. #MonumentsMen #GreatestGeneration 
Indefensible: Pres. Obama blocks pay for our troops, gives billions to Iranian terrorists 
Every Speaker of the House gets a gavel. Here's the story of how mine came to be. 
Great win in the House this week for #SchoolChoice. There‚Äôs a similar bipartisan bill in the Senate: 
One of the happiest privileges of my job has been presenting the #CongressionalGoldMedal. #MonumentsMen 
Honored to present the #CongressionalGoldMedal to the #MonumentsMen.

The Obama Admin has been stonewalling for 3yrs on giving us the documents needed to get to the truth on #Benghazi. 
This is the story of The Little Engine That Could ‚Üí 
Why won‚Äôt the Obama Admin let the American people see the truth about what really happened that night? #Benghazi 
The #DC Opportunity Scholarship Program has helped more than 6,100 students escape underperforming schools. 
.@HouseBenghazi was set up to do one thing: get to the truth about what happened before, during after the attack. 
GREAT NEWS ‚Üí The House just approved a bill to expand scholarships opportunity for students in Washington, #DC. 
#BREAKING: The State Dept *just* delivered nearly 900 additional printed pages of Ambassador Chris Stevens‚Äô emails. #Benghazi 
There is no place for politics when it comes to providing for our troops and their families. 
President Obama should do the right thing sign this #NationalDefense bill into law. #FY16NDAA 
Amazing photos from @USNatArchives of artifacts saved by #MonumentsMen. #CongressionalGoldMedal on Thursday. 
Great points from @USRepLong: The past two Congresses have hailed major accomplishments. 
If you do the right things, for the right reasons, the right things will happen for our country. 
Starting soon: Press Conference with @HouseGOP leadership: 
LIVE now for the signing of our national defense bill. #FY16NDAA #NoVeto 
Coming up at 5:00p ET, will sign national defense bill. #FY16NDAA 
This cause is at the core of who I am. #SchoolChoice 
‚ÄúThe notion that a child‚Äôs future need not be linked to the fate of his ZIP code is truly life-changing.‚Äù 
Obama admin. has tried to end DC #SchoolChoice. But the program is working. Let's keep it going. 
#BREAKING: The State Dept *just* delivered nearly 1,300 printed pages of new emails from Ambassador Chris Stevens. #Benghazi 
#MonumentsMen saved millions of artifacts during #WWII. Thursday we honor them with a #CongressionalGoldMedal: 
This week, the House will consider my plan to protect the DC #SchoolChoice program. Read the bill --&gt; 
In our 2010 Pledge to America, we vowed to stop out-of-control spending. We‚Äôve done just that: 
Only #Republicans are offering the real, meaningful solutions needed to tackle our debt:
