time when the voices against diversity are getting stronger must more embrace and empower the voiceless More diversity will not destroy what means Canadian foundational who are fundamental Canadian value 
those who feel targeted these comments want you know that youre very much Canadian and you strengthen all Canadas identity based inclusion and our unyielding belief lifting each other response attempts divide 
When you are told some that Canada wants less you understand the isolation you feel understand the uncertainty risk vulnerability and pain creates Comments like these make you feel like theres something wrong with you for just being you 
THREAD Ive waited respond Maxime Berniers comments see AndrewScheer would the responsible thing denounce these divisive words has not everyone that belongs diverse community whos been told you dont belong Ive been your shoes get

sum Kavanaugh doesnt think judges should consider public safety allow common-sense gun laws Meanwhile Americans are killed with guns every day Call your senators 224-3121 
Gun bans and gun regulations that are not longstanding sufficiently rooted the text history and tradition are not consistent with the Second Amendment individual right added 
Judge Kavanaugh dissented when the appeals court ruled that the city could ban semiautomatic rifles and require handgun registration argued that courts shouldnt consider the public safety benefits gun laws Our task apply the Constitution 
Lets talk about Brett Kavanaughs past rulings guns Hes out the mainstream even among other conservative judges his willingness strike down legislatures public safety measures prevent gun violence they dont align with his politics

Sen kamalaharris asked Brett Kavanaugh last week Can you think any laws that give the government the power make decisions about the male body said was not Because there are none 
Imagine America which women are barred from getting IUDs birth control pills and doctors are criminalized for prescribing them Its America which women would punished for insisting being full and equal partners society 
When Kavanaugh called birth control abortion-inducing drugs made clear that safe and legal abortion isnt the only fundamental reproductive right grave risk confirmed Access birth control too 
Kavanaugh didnt use that term because misunderstands the basic science birth controlthe fact that birth control prevents fertilization eggs the first place used that term because its dog whistle the extreme right 
want sure were all clear about something that Brett Kavanaugh said his confirmation hearings last week referred birth-control pills abortion-inducing drugs That set off lot alarm bells for and should for you too

Were not fighting for the planet some abstract sense here Were fighting for our continued ability live Call your senators 224-3121 
Just last year Kavanaugh ruled that the EPAs attempt phase out hydrofluorocarbons particularly dangerous greenhouse gas found refrigeration and air conditioning units was outside its authority 
argued that the Clean Air Act was thin statute support the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan cut carbon pollution from power plants 
Kavanaugh wrote majority opinion for the Circuit Court that struck down federal program curb cross-state pollution from power plants 
During the Obama years Kavanaugh came down against the EPA every one the three major cases heard about the agencys authority regulate greenhouse gases 
Replacing Kennedy with Kavanaugh would swing the Court new hard-right majority that would rule against curbing greenhouse gases for yearsmaybe decadesthat cant afford waste inaction 
Kavanaugh would replace Justice Kennedy who was the deciding vote pivotal Supreme Court case that established greenhouse gases were well within the EPAs authority regulate under the Clean Air Act and made possible for the agency start reining emissions 
Kavanaugh has consistently argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has limited authority under the Clean Air Act regulate the carbon and other pollutants that are causing the planet heat 
This year has seen record-high temperatures across the world the biggest wildfire California history and unprecedented red tide Florida Its urgent that act curb climate changeand Brett Kavanaugh the Supreme Court could make progress virtually impossible 
Six weeks after the administrations deadline reunify families children are still waiting 
Want run for office join campaign but unsure how get started youre near Philadelphia consider attending the ArenaSummit this weekend Its gathering for the next generation civic leaders 
This fight isnt over until its over and the only thing can count this era that these battles wont always end the way expect they will Share the number the Senate switchboard with friend right now 202-224-3121 
Just this year the Court upheld purges minority voters Ohio well districts Texas that were drawn reduce the voting power people color With solid hard-right majority the Court would see more decisions like those 
The Court gutted the Voting Rights Act ruling that states with history suppression longer needed federal approval change their voting laws Kavanaughs record indicates would help new majority kill the VRA entirely and approve even more suppression 
Voter fraudthe justification for voter lawshas also been proven virtually nonexistent problem recent Brennan Center report noted that American more likely struck lightning than impersonate someone else the polls 
wrote approvingly recent changes voting laws that include not just voter but also laws that put restrictions registration and cut back both early voting days and polling place locations All these changes are shown disproportionately affect voters color 
Kavanaugh voted uphold South Carolina voter law that the Obama administration found would disenfranchise minority voters 
Todays reason call your senators and urge them StopKavanaugh Kavanaugh would help kill the Voting Rights Act and uphold voter suppression laws that make harder for voters color cast ballots 
you agree please pick the phone right now and call your senators Ask them StopKavanaugh 224-3121 
One the most fundamental human rights the right make the most personal decisions about ones own body deny women that rob them the ability decide their own futures 
Its remarkable that have keep repeating this even Womens rights are human rights and human rights are womens rights 
Anti-abortion groups have endorsed Kavanaugh considering him reliable vote overturn Roe His confirmation would victory for activists who want end womans right make her own health decisions 
Kavanaugh ruled let CEOs decide deny their employees insurance coverage for co-pay birth control 
federal judge Kavanaugh tried prevent young undocumented woman government custody from exercising her right abortion 
few weeks before Kavanaughs name appeared President Trumps short list for new justice Kavanaugh praised the dissent the Roe Wade case and called former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist his hero noting that clearly wanted overrule Roe 
Brett Kavanaugh becomes Supreme Court justice will help gut overturn Roe Wade which legalized abortion America Yes course will 
This serious gets Its save health care for millions our fellow Americansagain Kavanaughs hearings begin make sure your senators hear from you 224-3121 
Supreme Court seats are for life Your senators votes Kavanaugh could affect whether you your loved ones and millions other Americans can get affordable health care for decades 
Kavanaugh has also claimed that the president can simply decide not implement the Affordable Care Act leaving millions Americans the lurch 
Kavanaugh dissented when the Court Appeals for the District Court upheld the consitutionality the ACA criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for ruling uphold the law five years earlier 
The next Supreme Court justice will have chance rule the fate the Affordable Care Act which helps millions people get affordable health care Brett Kavanaughs record shows hed threat the law 
Challenges the Affordable Care Acts protections for patients including the notion that insurance companies cant refuse insure you you have pre-existing condition are already working their way through the lower courts 
you have pre-existing condition you care about someone who has one Could you someone you love ever get one Then you should call your senators today StopKavanaugh from getting lifetime seat the Supreme Court Heres why 
Unions and labor movements are why have workplace safety precautions collective bargaining weekends minimum wages and yes Labor Day cant afford more damage workers rights Make sure your senators hear from you Lets StopKavanaugh 
Kavanaugh held that corporations have the right punish workers for displaying pro-union signs their cars 
dissented case where the Occupational Safety and Health Administration held SeaWorld accountable for the death trainer 
Kavanaugh wrote opinion that severely limited union rights and allowed major damage federal workers ability bargain collectively 
other words the Court has already been widening the disparity power between corporations and workers Kavanaughs record from his time judge the Court Appeals for the District Columbia shows hed help further that trend for generation 
The Court has also recently granted corporations the right deny workers reproductive health care and made harder for workers sue businesses allowing companies force employees sign mandatory arbitration clauses with their contracts 
That ruling wont just hurt seven million public-sector union workers with contracts Itll hurt all workers because union deals wages and working conditions affect what businesses without unions too 
The Courts ruling Janus AFSCME earlier this summer overturned 40-year-old precedent hold that public-sector workers with union contracts dont have pay fees for collective bargaining expenses theyre not members 
The Roberts Court has dealt some big blows workers and unions the last few years With Kavanaugh the Court 5-4 hard-right majority would even more aggressive siding with corporations over people 
Happy Labor Day Theres better time talk about why workers rights would suffer Brett Kavanaugh whose hearings for lifetime appointment the Supreme Court start tomorrow confirmed
